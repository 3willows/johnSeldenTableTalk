Humility.

1. HUmility is a Vertue all preach, none practise, and yet every bo∣dy is content to hear. The Master thinks it good Doctrine for his Servant, the Laity for the Clergy, and the Clergy for the Laity.

2. There is Humilitas quaedam in Vitio. If a Man does not take notice of that Excellency and Perfection that is in him∣self, how can he be thankful to God, who is the Author of all Excellency and Perfection? Nay, if a Man hath too mean an Opinion of himself, 'twill render him unserviceable both to God and Man.

3. Pride may be allow'd to this or that degree, else a Man cannot keep up his Dignity. In Gluttony there must be Eat∣ing, in Drunkenness there must be drink∣ing; 'tis not the eating, nor 'tis not the drinking that is to be blam'd, but the Ex∣cess. So in Pride.
