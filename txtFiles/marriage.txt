Marriage.

1. OF all Actions of a Man's Life, his Marriage does least concern other people, yet of all Actions of our Life 'tis most medled with by other People.

2. Marriage is nothing but a civil Con∣tract; 'tis true, 'tis an Ordinance of God: so is every other Contract, God com∣mands me to keep it when I have made it.

3. Marriage is a desperate thing; the Frogs in Aesop were extream wise, they had a great mind to some Water, but they would not leap into the Well, be∣cause they could not get out again.

4. We single out particulars, and ap∣ply God's Providence to them, thus when two are marry'd and have undone one another, they cry it was God's Provi∣dence we should come together, when God's Providence does equally concur to every thing.
