Law of Nature.

1. I Cannot fancy to my self what the Law of Nature means, but the Law of God. How should I know I ought not to steal, I ought not to commit Aâˆ£dultery, unless some body had told me so? Surely 'tis because I have been told so? 'Tis not because I think I ought not to do them, nor because you think I ought not; if so, our minds might change, whence then comes the Restraint? from a higher Power, nothing else can bind: I cannot bind my self, for I may untye my self again; nor an equal cannot bind me, for we may untie one another: It must be a superiour Power, even God Almighty. If two of us make a Bargain, why should either of us stand to it? What need you care what you say, or what need I care what I say? Certainly because there is something about me that tells me Fides est servanda, and if we after alter our Minds, and make a new Bargain, there's Fides servanda there too.
