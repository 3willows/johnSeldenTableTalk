Idolatry.

1. IDolatry is in a Man's own Thought, not in the Opinion of another. Put Case I bow to the Altar, why am I guilty of Idolatry? because a stander by thinks so; I am sure I do not believe the Altar to be God, and the God I worship may be bow'd to in all Places, and at all times.

Jews.

1. GOD at the first gave Laws to all Manking, but afterwards he gave peculiar Laws to the Jews, which they were only to observe. Just as we have the Common Law for all England, and yet you have some Corporations, that besides that have peculiar Laws and Pri∣viledges to themselves.

2. Talk what you will of the Jews, that they are cursed, they thrive where e'er they come, they are able to oblige the Prince of their Country, by lend∣ing him Money; none of them beg, they keep together, and for their being hated, my Life for yours Christians hate one ano∣ther as much.
