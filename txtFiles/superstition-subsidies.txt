Superstition.

1. THey that are against Superstition oftentimes run into it of the wrong side. If I will wear all colours but black, then am I superstitious in not wearing black.

2. They pretend not to abide the Cross, because 'tis superstitious; for my part I will believe them, when I see them throw their Money out of their Pockets, and not tell then.

3. If there be any Superstition truly and properly so called, 'tis their obser∣ving the Sabbòth after the Jewish Man∣ner.

Subsidies.

1. HEretofore the Parliament was wa∣ry what Subsidies they gave to the King, because they had no account; but now they care not how much they give of the Subjects Money, because they give it with one hand, and receive it with the other; and so upon the matter give it themselves. In the mean time what a case the Subjects of England are in; if the Men they have sent to the Parliament mis-behave themselves, they cannot help it, because the Parliament is Eternal.

2. A Subsidy was counted the fifth part of a Man's Estate, and so fifty Sub∣sidies is five and forty times more than a Man is Worth.
