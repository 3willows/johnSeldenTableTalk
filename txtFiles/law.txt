Law.

1. A Man may plead not guilty, and yet tell no Lye; for by the Law, no Man is bound to accuse himself; so that when I say Not Guilty, the mean∣ing is, as if I should say by way of Pa∣raphrase, I am not so Guilty as to tell you; if you will bring me to a Tryal, and have me punish'd for this you lay to my Charge, prove it against me.

2. Ignorance of the Law excuses no man; not that all Men know the Law, but because 'tis an excuse every Man will plead, and no Man can tell how to con∣fute him.

3. The King of Spain was outlaw'd in Westminster-Hall, I being of Council a∣gainst him. A Merchant had recover'd Costs against him in a Suit, which because he could not get, we advis'd to have him Out-law'd for not appearing, and so he was. As soon as Gondimer heard that, he presently sent the Money, by reason, if his Master had been Out-law'd, he could not have the Benefit of the Law, which would have been very prejudicial, there being then many Suits depending be∣twixt the King of Spain, and our English Merchants.

4. Every Law is a Contract between the King and the People, and therefore to be kept. A hundred Men may owe me an Hundred Pounds, as well as any one Man, and shall they not pay me be∣cause they are stronger than I? Object. Oh but they lose all if they keep that Law. Answ. Let them look to the making of their Bargain. If I sell my Lands, and when I have done, one comes and tells me I have nothing else to keep me. I and my Wife and Children must starve, If I part with my Land; must I not therefore let them have my Land, that have bought it and paid for it?

5. The Parliament may declare Law, as well as any other inferiour Court may, (viz.) the King's Bench. In that or this particular Case, the King's Bench will de∣clare unto you what the Law is, but that binds no body whom the Case concerns: So the highest Court, the Parliament may doe, but not declare Law, that is, make Law that was never heard of before.
