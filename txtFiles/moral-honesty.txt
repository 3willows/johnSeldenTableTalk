Moral Honesty.

1. THey that cry down moral Honesty, cry down that which is a great part of Religion, my Duty towards God, and my Duty towards Man. What care I to see a Man run after a Sermon, if he couzens and cheats as soon as he comes home. On the other side Morality must not be without Religion, for if so, it may change, as I see convenience. Religion must govern it. He that has not Religion to govern his Morality, is not a Dram better than my Mastiff-Dog; so long as you stroke him, and please him, and do not pinch him, he will play with you as finely as may be, he is a very good moâˆ£ral-Mastiff; but if you hurt him, he will fly in your Face, and tear out your Throat.
