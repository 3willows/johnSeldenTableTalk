Patience.

1. PAtience is the chiefest fruit of Stu∣dy, a Man that strives to make himself a different thing from other Men by much reading, gains this chiefest Good, that in all Fortunes, he hath something to entertain and comfort himself withal.

Peace.

1. KIng James was pictur'd going easi∣ly down a Pair of Stairs, and up∣pon every Step there was written, Peace, Peace, Peace; the wisest way for men in these times is to say nothing.

2. When a Country-wench cannot get her Butter to come, she says, the Witch is in her Churn. We have been churn∣ing for Peace a great while, and 'twill not come, sure the Witch is in it.

3. Though we had Peace, yet 'twill be a great while e'er things be settled: Tho' the Wind lie, yet after a Storm the Sea will work a great while.
