Simony.

1. THE Name of Simony was begot in the Canon-Law; the first Statute against it was in Queen Elizabeth's time. Since the Reformation Simony has been frequent: One reason why it was not practised in time of Popery, was the Pope's provision; no Man was sure to bestow his own Benefice.

Ship-Money.

1. MR. Noy brought in Ship-money first for Maritine Towns; but that was like putting in a little Augur, that afterwards you may put in a greaâˆ£ter: He that pulls down the first Brick, does the main Work, afterwards 'tis easie to pull down the Wall.

2. They that at first would not pay Ship-money, till 'twas decided, did like brave Men, (though perhaps they did no good by the Trial) but they that stand out since, and suffer themselves to be distrained, never questioning those that do it, do pitifully, for so they only pay twice as much as they should.
