Holy-Days.

1. THey say the Church imposes Holy-Days, there's no such thing, tho' the Number of Holy-days is set down in some of our Common-Prayer Books. Yet that has relation to an Act of Parliament, which forbids the keeping of any Holy-Days in time of Popery; but those that are kept, are kept by the Custom of the Country, and I hope you will not say the Church imposes that.
