Friends.

1. OLD Friends are best. King James us'd to call for his old Shoos, they were easiest for his Feet.

Genealogy of Christ.

1. They that say the Reason why Jo∣seph's Pedigree is set down, and not Mary's, is, because the Descent from the Mother is lost, and swallowed up, say something; but yet if a Jewish Wo∣man, marry'd with a Gentil, they only took Notice of the Mother, not of the Father; but they that say they were both of a Tribe, say nothing; for the Tribes might marry one with another, and the Law against it was only Temporary, in the time while Joshua was dividing the Land, lest the being so long about it, there might be a confusion.

2. That Christ was the Son of Joseph is most exactly true. For though he was the Son of God, yet with the Jews, if any Man kept a Child, and brought him up, and call'd him Son, he was taken for his Son; and his Land (if he had any) was to descend upon him; and there∣fore the Genealogy of Joseph is justly set down.
