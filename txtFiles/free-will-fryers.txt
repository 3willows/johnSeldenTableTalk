Free-will.

1. THe Puritans who will allow no Free-will at all, but God does all, yet will allow the Subject his Liberty to do, or not to do, notwithstanding the King, the God upon Earth. The Armenians, who hold we have Free-will, yet say, when we come to the King, there must be all Obedience, and no Liberty to be stood for.

Fryers.
1. THE Fryers say they possess no∣thing, whose then are the Lands they hold? not their Superiour's, he hath vow'd Poverty as well as they, whose then? To answer this, 'twas decreed they should say they were the Popes. And why must the Fryers be more perfect than the Pope himself?

2. If there had been no Fryers, Chri∣stendom might have continued quiet, and things remain at a stay.

If there had been no Lecturers (which succeed the Fryers in their way) the Church of England might have stood, and flourisht at this Day.
