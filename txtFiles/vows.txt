Vows.

1. SUppose a Man find by his own In∣clination he has no mind to mar∣ry, may he not then vow Chastity? Answ. If he does, what a fine thing hath he done? 'tis as if a Man did not love Cheefe, and then he would vow to God Almighty never to eat Cheese. He that vows can mean no more in sense, than this; To do his utmost endeavour to keep his Vow.
