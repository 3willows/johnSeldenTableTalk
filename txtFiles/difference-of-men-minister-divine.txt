Difference of Men.
1. THE Difference of Men is very great, you would scarce think them to be of the same Species, and yet it con∣sists more in the Affection than in the Intellect. For as in the Strength of Bo∣dy, two Men shall be of an equal Strength, yet one shall appear stronger than the o∣ther, because he exercises, and puts out his Strength, the other will not stir nor strain himself. So 'tis in the Strength of the Brain, the one endeavours, and strains, and labours, and studies, the other sits still, and is idle, and takes no pains, and there∣fore he appears so much the inferiour.

Minister Divine.
1. THE imposition of Hands upon the Minister when all is done, will be nothing but a designation of a Person to this or that Office or Employ∣ment in the Church. 'Tis a ridiculous Phrase that of the Canonists [Conferre Or∣dines] 'Tis Coaptare aliquem in Ordinem, to make a Man one of us, one of our Number, one of our Order. So Cicero would understand what I said, it being a Phrase borrowed from the Latines, and to be understood proportionably to what was amongst them.

2. Those Words you now use in ma∣king a Minister [receive the Holy Ghost] were us'd amongst the Jews in making of a Lawyer; from thence we have them, which is a villanous Key to something, as if you would have some other kind of Praefeture, than a Mayoralty, and yet keep the same Ceremony that was us'd in making the Mayor.

3. A Priest has no such thing as an in∣indelible Character: what difference do you find betwixt him and another Man after Ordination? only he is made a Priest, (as I said) by Designation; as a Lawyer is call'd to the Bar, then made a Serjeant: all Men that would get Pow∣er over others, make themselves as unlike them as they can, upon the same Ground the Priests made themselves un∣like the Laity.
