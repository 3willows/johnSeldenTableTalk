Bastard.

1. 'TIS said the 23d. of Deuteron. 2. [A Bastard shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth Generation.] Non ingredietur in Ec∣clesiam Domini, he shall not enter into the Church. The meaning of the Phraise is, he shall not marry a Jewish Woman. But upon this grosly mistaken; a Bastard at this Day in the Church of Rome, with∣out a Dispensation, cannot take Orders; the thing haply well enough where 'tis so settled; but 'tis upon a Mistake, (the Place having no reference to the Church) appears plainly by what follows at the third Verse [An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth Generation.] Now you know with the Jews an Ammonite or a Moabite could never be a Priest; because their Priests were born so, not made.
