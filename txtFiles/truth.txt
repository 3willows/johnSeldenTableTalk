1. THE Aristotelians say, All Truth is contained in Aristotle in one place or another. Galilaeo makes Simpli∣cius say so, but shows the absurdity of that Speech, by answering, All Truth is contained in a lesser Compass; viz. In the Alphabet. Aristotle is not blam'd for mi∣staking sometimes; but Aristotelians for maintaining those Mistakes. They should acknowledge the good they have from him, and leave him when he is in the wrong. There never breath'd that Per∣son to whom Mankind was more be∣holden.

The way to find out the Truth is by others mistakings: For if I was to go to such a place, and one had gone be∣fore me on the Right-hand, and he was out; another had gone on the Left-hand, and he was out; this would direct me to keep the middle way, that peradven∣ture would bring me to the place I de∣sir'd to go.
