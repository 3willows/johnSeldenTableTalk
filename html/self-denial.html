<p>Self Denyal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>’TIS much the Doctrine of the times, that Men should not please
them∣selves, but deny themselves every thing they take delight in; not
look upon Beau∣ty, wear no good Cloaths, eat no good Meat, &amp;c. which
seems the greatest Ac∣cusation that can be upon the Maker of all good
things. If they be not to be us’d, why did God make them? The truth is,
they that preach against them, cannot make use of them their selves, and
then again, they get Esteem by seeming to contemn them. But mark it
while you live, if they do not please themselves as much as they can,
and we live more by Example than Precept.</li>
