<p>Idolatry.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>IDolatry is in a Man’s own Thought, not in the Opinion of another.
Put Case I bow to the Altar, why am I guilty of Idolatry? because a
stander by thinks so; I am sure I do not believe the Altar to be God,
and the God I worship may be bow’d to in all Places, and at all
times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jews.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>GOD at the first gave Laws to all Manking, but afterwards he gave
peculiar Laws to the Jews, which they were only to observe. Just as we
have the Common Law for all England, and yet you have some Corporations,
that besides that have peculiar Laws and Pri∣viledges to
themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk what you will of the Jews, that they are cursed, they thrive
where e’er they come, they are able to oblige the Prince of their
Country, by lend∣ing him Money; none of them beg, they keep together,
and for their being hated, my Life for yours Christians hate one
ano∣ther as much.</p></li>
