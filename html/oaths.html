<p>Oaths.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>SWearing was another thing with the Jews than with us, because
they might not pronounce the Name of the Lord Jehovah.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no Oath scarcely, but we swear to things we are ignorant
of: For Example, the Oath of Supremacy; how many know how the King is
King? what are his Right and Prerogative? So how many know what are the
Privi∣ledges of the Parliament, and the Liber∣ty of the Subject, when
they take the protestation? But the meaning is, they will defend them
when they know them. As if I should swear I would take part with all
that wear red Ribbons in their Hats, it may be I do not know which
Colour is Red; but when I do know, and see a red Ribbon in a Man’s Hat,
then will I take his Part.</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot conceive how an Oath is imposed, where there is a Parity
(viz.) in the House of Commons, they are all pares inter se, onely one
brings Paper, and shews it the rest, they look upon it, and in their own
Sense take it: Now they are but pares to me, who am none of the House,
for I do not acknow∣ledge my self their Subject; if I did, then no
question, I was bound by an Oath of their imposing. ’Tis to me but
read∣ing a Paper in their own Sense.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a great difference between an Assertory Oath, and a
Promissary Oath. An Assertory Oath is made to a Man be∣fore God, and I
must swear so, as Man may know what I mean: But a Promis∣sary Oath is
made to God only, and I am sure he knows my meaning: so in the new Oath
it runs [whereas I believe in my Conscience, &amp;c. I will assist thus
and thus] that [whereas] gives me an Outloofe, for if I do not believe
so, for ought I know, I swear not at all.</p></li>
<li><p>In a Promissary Oath, the mind I am in is a good Interpretation;
for if there be enough happen’d to change my mind, I do not know why I
should not. If I promise to go to Oxford to Morrow, and mean it when I
say it, and afterwards it appears to me, that ’twill be my undo∣ing;
will you say I have broke my Pro∣mise if I stay at Home? certainly I
must not go.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jews had this way with them, concerning a Promissary Oath or
Vow, if one of them had vow’d a Vow, which afterwards appear’d to him to
be very prejudicial by reason of something he either did not foresee, or
did not think of, when he made his Vow; if he made it known to three of
his Country-men, they had Power to absolve him, though he could not
absolve himself, and that they pick’d out of some Words in the Text:
Perjury hath only to do with an Assertory Oath, and no Man was punisht
for Perjury by Man’s Law till Queen Eli∣zabeth’s time ’twas left to God,
as a sin against him; the Reason was, because ’twas so hard a thing to
prove a Man perjur’d: I might misunderstand him, and he swears as he
thought.</p></li>
<li><p>When Men ask me whether they may take an Oath in their own Sense,
’tis to me, as if they should ask whether they may go to such a place
upon their own Legs, I would fain know how they can go
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Ministers that are in seque∣stred Livings will not take
the Engage∣ment, threaten to turn them out and put in the old ones, and
then I’ll war∣rant you they will quietly take it. A Gentleman having
been rambling two or three Days, at length came home, and being in Bed
with his Wife, would fain have been at some thing, that she was
unwilling to, and instead of complying, fell to chiding him for his
being abroad so long: Well says he, if you will not, call up Sue (his
Wife’s Chamber-maid) upon that she yielded presently.</p></li>
<li><p>Now Oaths are so frequent, they should be taken like Pills,
swallowed whole; if you chew them you will find them bitter: if you
think what you swear ’twill hardly go down.</p></li>
