<p>Bishops in the Parliament.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bishops have the same Right to sit in Parliament as the best
Earls and Barons, that is, those that were made by Writ: If you ask one
of them [Arundel, Oxford, Northumberland] why they sit in the House?
they can only say, their Fa∣thers sate there before them, and their
Grandfather before him, &amp;c. And so say the Bishops, he that was a
Bishop of this Place before me, sate in the House, and he that was a
Bishop before him, &amp;c. Indeed your latter Earls and Barons have it
express’d in their Patents, that they shall be called to the Parliament.
Objection, but the Lords sit there by Blood, the Bishops not. Answer,
’Tis true, they sit not there both the same way, yet that takes not away
the Bishops Right: If I am a Parson of a Parish, I have as much Right to
my Gleab and Tithe, as you have to your Land which your Ancestors have
had in that Parish Eight Hundred Years.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bishops were not Barons, be∣cause they had Baronies annex’d
to their Bishopricks (for few of them had so, unless the old ones,
Canterbury, Winchester, Dur∣ham, &amp;c. the new erected we are sure had
none, as Glocester, Peterborough, &amp;c. be∣sides few of the Temporal
Lords had a∣ny Baronies.) But they are Barons, because they are called
by Writ to the Parliament, and Bishops were in the Parliament ever since
there was any mention, or sign of a Parliament in England.</p></li>
<li><p>Bishops may be judged by the Peers, tho’ in time of Popery it
never hapned, because they pretended they were not obnoxious to a
secular Court; but their way was to cry Ego sum Frater Domini Pa∣pae, I
am Brother to my Lord the Pope, and therefore take not my self to be
judg∣ed by you; in this Case they impanell’d a Middlesex Jury, and
dispatch’d the Busi∣ness.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether may Bishops be present in Cases of Blood? Answ. That they
had a Right to give Votes, appears by this, al∣ways when they did go
out, they left a Proxy, and in the time of the Abbots, one Man had 10,
20 or 30 Voices. In Richard the Second’s time, there was a Protestati∣on
against the Canons, by which they were forbidden to be present in Case
of Blood. The Statute of 25th. of Henry the Eighth may go a great way in
this Busi∣ness. The Clergy were forbidden to use or cite any Canon
&amp;c. but in the latter End of the Statute, there was a Clause, that
such Canons that were in usage in this Kingdom, should be in force till
the thir∣ty two Commissioners appointed should make others, provided
they were not con∣trary to the King’s Supremacy. Now the Question will
be, whether these Canons for Blood were in use in this Kingdom or no?
the contrary whereof may appear by many Presidents in R. 3. and H. 7.
and the beginning of H. 8. in which time there were more attainted than
since, or scarce before: The Canons of Irregula∣rity of Blood were never
receiv’d in Eng∣land, but upon pleasure. If a Lay-Lord was attainted,
the Bishops assented to his Condemning, and were always pre∣sent at the
passing of the Bill of Attainder. But if a Spiritual Lord, they went
out, as if they car’d not whose Head was cut off, so none of their own.
In those Days, the Bishops being of great Houses, were often entangled
with the Lords in Mat∣ters of Treason. But when d’ye hear of Bishop a
Traytor now?</p></li>
<li><p>You would not have Bishops meddle with Temporal Affairs, think
who you are that say it. If a Papist, they do in your Church; if an
English Protestant, they do among you; if a Presbyterian, where you have
no Bishops, you mean your Presbyterian Lay-Elders, should meddle with
temporal Affairs as well as Spiritual. Besides all Jurisdicti∣on is
Temporal, and in no Church, but they have some Jurisdiction or other.
The Question then will be reduced to Magis and Minus; They meddle more
in one Church than in another.</p></li>
<li><p>Objection. Bishops give not their Votes by Blood in Parliament,
but by an Office annext to them, which being taken away they cease to
vote, there∣fore there is not the same Reason for them as for Temporal
Lords. Answ. We do not pretend they have that Pow∣er the same Way, but
they have a Right: He that has an Office in Westminster-Hall for his
Life, the Office is as much his, as his Land is his that hath Land by
Inheritance.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether had the inferior Clergy ever any thing to do in the
Parlia∣ment? Answ. No, no otherwise than thus, There were certain of the
Clergy that used to assemble near the Parliament, with whom the Bishops,
upon occasion might consult (but there were none of the Con∣vocation, as
’twas afterwards settled, (viz.) the Dean, the Arch-Deacon, one for the
Chapter, and two for the Diocess) but it happened by continuance of time
(to save Charges and Trouble) their Voices and the Consent of the whole
Clergy were involved in the Bishops and at this Day the Bishops, Writs
run, to bring all these to the Parliament, but the Bi∣shops themselves
stand for all.</p></li>
<li><p>Bishops were formerly one of these two Conditions, either Men
bred Ca∣nonists and Civilians, sent up and down Ambassadors to Rome and
other Parts, and so by their Merit came to that Greatness, or else great
Noble Men’s Sons, Brothers, and Nephews, and so born to govern the
State: Now they are of a low Condition, their Education no∣thing of that
way; he gets a Living, and then a greater Living, and then a greater
than that, and so comes to go∣vern.</p></li>
<li><p>Bishops are now unfit to Govern, be∣cause of their Learning, they
are bred up in another Law, they run to the Text for something done
amongst the Jews that nothing concerns England; ’tis just as if a Man
would have a Kettle, and he would not go to our Brazier to have it made,
as they make Kettles, but he would have it made as Hiram made his
Brass-work, who wrought in Solo∣mon’s Temple.</p></li>
<li><p>To take away Bishops Votes, is but the beginning to take them
away; for then they can be no longer useful to the King or State. ’Tis
but like the little Wimble, to let in the greater An∣ger. Objection. But
they are but for their Life, and that makes them always go for the King
as he will have them. Answer. This is against a Double Charity, for you
must always suppose a bad King and bad Bishops. Then again, whether will
a Man be sooner content, himself should be made a Slave, or his Son
after him? [when we talk of our Children, we mean our selves,] besides,
they that have Posterity are more obliged to the King, than they that
are only for them∣selves, in all the Reason in the World.</p></li>
<li><p>How shall the Clergy be in the Parliament, if the Bishops are
taken away? Answer. By the Laity, because the Bi∣shops, in whom the rest
of the Clergy are included, are sent to the taking away their own Votes,
by being involv’d in the major Part of the House. This fol∣lows
naturally.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bishops being put out of the House, whom will they lay the
Fault upon now? When the Dog is beat out of the Room, where will they
lay the Stink?</p></li>
