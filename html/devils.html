<p>Devils. 1. WHY have we none possest with Devils in England? The old
Answer is, the Protestants the Devil hath already, and the Papists are
so Holy, he dares not meddle with them. Why, then beyond Seas where a
Nun is possest, when a Hugonot comes into the Church, does not the Devil
hunt them out? The Priest teaches him, you never saw the Devil throw up
a Nun’s Coats, mark that, the Priest will not suffer it, for then the
Peo∣ple will spit at him.</p>

<li><p>Casting out Devils is meer Juggling; they never cast out any but
what they first cast in. They do it where for Reve∣rence no Man shall
dare to examine it, they do it in a Corner, in a Mortice-hole, not in
the Market-place. They do nothing but what may be done by Art, they make
the Devil fly out of the Window, in the Likeness of a Bat or a Rat, why
do they not hold him? Why in the Likeness of a Bat, or a Rat, or some
Creature? That is, why not in some shape we paint him in, with Claws and
Horns? By this trick they gain much, gain upon Mens Fancies, and so are
reverenc’d: and certainly if the Priest deliver me from him that is my
most deadly Enemy, I have all the reason in the World to reverence him.
Objection. But if this be Juggling, why do they punish Impostures?
Answer. For great reason, because they don’t play their Part well, and
for fear others should discover them; and so all of them ought to be of
the same Trade.</p></li>
<li><p>A Person of Quality came to my Chamber in the Temple, and told me
he had two Devils in his Head [I won∣der’d what he meant] and just at
that time, one of them bid him kill me, [with that I begun to be afraid,
and thought he was mad] he said he knew I could cure him; and therefore
entreated me to give him something; for he was resol∣ved he would go to
no body else. I perceiving what an Opinion he had of me, and that ’twas
only Melancholly that troubl’d him, took him in hand, warranted him, if
he would follow my Directions, to cure him in a short time. I desired
him to let me be alone about an Hour, and then to come again, which he
was very willing to. In the mean time I got a Card, and lap’d it up
handsome in a Piece of Taffata, and put Strings to the Taffata, and when
he came, gave it him to hang about his Neck, withal charged him, that he
should not disor∣der himself neither with Eating or Drinking, but eat
very little of Supper, and say his Prayers duly when he went to Bed, and
I made no Que∣stion but he would be well in three or four Days. Within
that time I went to Dinner to his House, and ask’d him how he did? He
said he was much bet∣ter, but not perfectly well, or in truth he had not
dealt clearly with me. He had four Devils in his Head, and he per∣ceiv’d
two of them were gone, with that which I had given him, but the other
two troubled him still. Well, said I, I am glad two of them are gone, I
make no doubt but to get away the other two like∣wise; so I gave him
another thing to hang about his Neck. Three Days after he came to me to
my Chamber and profest he was now as well as ever he was in his Life,
and did extreamly thank me for the great Care I had taken of him. I
fearing lest he might relapse into the like Distemper, told him that
there was none but my self, and one Physician more in the whole Town
that could cure the Devils in the Head, and that was Dr. Harvey (whom I
had pre∣par’d) and wish’d him if ever he found himself ill in my
Absence, to go to him, for he could cure his Disease as well as my self.
The Gentleman lived many Years and was never troubled after.</p></li>

<p>Self Denyal. 1. ’TIS much the Doctrine of the times, that Men should
not please them∣selves, but deny themselves every thing they take
delight in; not look upon Beau∣ty, wear no good Cloaths, eat no good
Meat, &amp;c. which seems the greatest Ac∣cusation that can be upon the
Maker of all good things. If they be not to be us’d, why did God make
them? The truth is, they that preach against them, cannot make use of
them their selves, and then again, they get Esteem by seeming to contemn
them. But mark it while you live, if they do not please themselves as
much as they can, and we live more by Example than Precept.</p>
