<p>Hell. 1. THere are two Texts for Christ’s de∣scending into Hell: The
one Psal. 16. The other Acts the 2d. where the Bible, that was in use
when the Thirty Nine Articles were made has it (Hell.) But the Bible
that was in Queen Eliza∣beth’s time, when the Articles were con∣firm’d,
reads it (Grave,) and so it con∣tinued till the new Translation in King
Jame’s time, and then ’tis Hell again. But by this we may gather the
Church of En∣gland declin’d as much as they could, the descent,
otherwise they never would have alter’d the Bible.</p>

<li>[He descended into Hell] this may be the Interpretation of it. He
may be dead and buried, then his Soul ascended in∣to Heaven. Afterwards
he descended a∣gain into Hell, that is, into the Grave, to fetch his
Body, and to rise again. The Ground of this Interpretation is taken from
the Platonick Learning, who held a Metampsychosis, and when a Soul did
de∣scend from Heaven, to take another Bo∣dy, they call’d it 〈 in
non-Latin alphabet 〉, taking 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, for the lower
World, the State of Mortality: Now the first Chri∣stians many of them
were Platonick Phi∣losophers, and no question spake such Language as was
then understood amongst them. To understand by Hell the Grave is no
Tautology, because the Creed first tells what Christ suffered, He was
Cruci∣fied, Dead, and Buried; then it tells us what he did, He descended
into Hell, the third day he rose again, he ascended, &amp;c.</li>
