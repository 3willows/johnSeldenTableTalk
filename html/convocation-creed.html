<p>Convocation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WHen the King sends his Writ for a Parliament, he sends for two
Knights for a Shire, and two Burgesses for a Corporation: But when he
sends for two Arch-Bishops for a Convocation, he commands them to
assemble the whole Clergy, but they out of Custom amongst themselves
send to the Bishops of their Provinces to will them to bring two Clerks
for a Diocess, the Dean, one for the Chap∣ter, and the Arch-Deacons; but
to the King every Clergy-Man is there present.</p></li>
<li><p>We having nothing so nearly ex∣presses the Power of a
Convocation, in respect of a Parliament, as a Court-Leet, where they
have a Power to make By-Laws, as they call them; as that a Man shall put
so many Cows, or Sheep in the Common, but they can make nothing that is
contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom.</p></li>

<p>Creed. 1. A Thanasius’s Creed is the shortest, take away the Preface,
and the Force, and the Conclusion, which are not part of the Creed. In
the Nicene Creed it is 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, I believe in the
Church; but now, as our Common-prayer has it, I believe one Catholick
and Apostolick Church: they like not Creeds, because they would have no
Forms of Faith, as they have none of Prayer, though there be more Reason
for the one, than for the other.</p>
