<p>Thanksgiving.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>AT first we gave Thanks for eve∣ry Victory as soon as ever ’twas
obtained; but since we have had many, now we can stay a good while. We
are just like a Child; give him a Plum, he makes his Leg; give him a
second Plum, he makes another Leg: At last when his Belly is full, he
forgets what he ought to do; then his Nurse, or some body else that
stands by him, puts him in mind of his Duty, Where’s your Leg?</li>
</ol>
<p>Tythes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>TYthes are more paid in kind in Eng∣land, than in all Italy and
France. In France they have had Impropriations a long time; we had none
in England till Henry the Eighth.</p></li>
<li><p>To make an Impropriation, there was to be the Consent of the
Incumbent, the Patron, and the King; then ’twas confirm’d by the Pope:
Without all this the Pope could make no Impro∣priation.</p></li>
<li><p>Or what if the Pope gave the Tythes to any Man, must they
therefore be ta∣ken away? If the Pope gives me a Jewel, will you
therefore take it away from me?</p></li>
<li><p>Abraham paid Tythes to Melchize∣deck, what then? ’Twas very well
done of him: It does not follow therefore that I must pay Tythes, no
more than I am bound to imitate any other Action of Abraham’s.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis ridiculous to say the Tythes are God’s Part, and therefore
the Clergy must have them: Why, so they are if the Laymen has them. ’Tis
as if one of my Lady Kent’s Maids should be sweep∣ing this Room, and
another of them should come and take away the Broom, and tell for a
Reason, why she should part with it; ’Tis my Lady’s Broom: As if it were
not my Lady’s Broom, which of them soever had it.</p></li>
<li><p>They consulted in Oxford where they might find the best Argument
for their Tythes, setting aside the Jus Di∣vinum; they were advis’d to
my Histo∣ry of Tythes; a Book so much cry’d down by them formerly; (in
which, I dare boldly say, there are more Argu∣ments for them than are
extant together any where:) Upon this, one writ me word, That my History
of Tythes was now become like Pleus’s Hasta, to wound and to heal. I
told him in my Answer, I thought I could fit him with a better Instance.
’Twas possible it might under∣go the same Fate, that Aristotle, Avicen,
and Averroes did in France, some five hundred Years ago; which were
Excom∣municated by Stephen Bishop of Paris, [by that very Name,
Excommunicated,] be∣cause that kind of Learning puzled and troubled
their Divinity. But finding them∣selves at a Loss, some Forty Years
after (which is much about the time since I writ my History) they were
call’d in a∣gain, and so have continued ever since.</p></li>
