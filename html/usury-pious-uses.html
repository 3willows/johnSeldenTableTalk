<p>Usury.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Jews were forbidden to take Use one of another, but they were
not forbidden to take it of other Nations. That being so, I see no
reason, why I may not as well take Use for my Money, as Rent for my
House. ’Tis a vain thing to say, Money begets not Money; for that no
doubt it does.</p></li>
<li><p>Would it not look odly to a Stran∣ger, that should come into this
Land, and hear in our Pulpits Usury preach’d a∣gainst, and yet the Law
allow it? Ma∣ny Men use it; pehaps some Church∣men themselves. No Bishop
nor Eccle∣siastical Judge, that pretends Power to punish other Faults,
dares punish, or at least does punish any Man for doing it.</p></li>

<p>Pious Uses.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THE ground of the Ordinary’s taking part of a Man’s Estate (who dy’d
without a Will) to Pious Uses, was this; to give it some body to pray,
that his Soul might be deliver’d out of Purgatory; now the pious Uses
come in∣to his own Pocket. ’Twas well exprest by John O Powls in the
Play, who acted the Priest; one that was to be hang’d, being brought to
the Ladder, would fain have given something to the Poor; he feels for
his Purse, (which John O Powls had pickt out of his Pocket before)
mis∣sing it, crys out, He had lost his Purse; now he intended to have
given some∣thing to the Poor; John O Powls bid him be pacified, for the
Poor had it already.</li>
