<p>Land.</p>

<li><p>WHen Men did let their Land un∣derfoot, the Tenants would fight
for their Landlords, so that way they had their Retribution: but now
they will do nothing for them, may be the first, if but a Constable bid
them, that shall lay the Landlord by the Heels, and there∣fore ’tis
vanity and folly not to take the full value.</p></li>
<li><p>Allodium is a Law Word, contra∣ry to Feudum, and it signifies
Land that holds of no body. We have no such Land in England. ’Tis a true
Proposition; all the Land in England is held, either imme∣diately, or
mediately of the King.</p></li>

<p>Language.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>TO a living Tongue new Words may be added, but not to a dead
Tongue, as Latin, Greek, Hebrew, &amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>Latimer is the Corruption of Lati∣ner, it signifies he that
interprets Latin, and though he interpreted French, Spanish, or Italian,
he was call’d the King’s Lati∣ner, that is, the King’s
Interpreter.</p></li>
<li><p>If you look upon the Language spoken in the Saxon Time, and the
Lan∣guage spoken now, you will find the Diffe∣rence to be just, as if a
Man had a Cloak that he wore plain in Queen Elizabeth’s Days, and since,
here has put in a piece of Red, and there a piece of Blue, and here a
piece of Green, and there a piece of Orange-tawny. We borrow Words from
the French, Italian, Latin, as every Pedantick Man pleases.</p></li>
<li><p>We have more Words than Noti∣ons, half a Dozen Words for the same
thing. Sometimes we put a new signi∣fication to an old Word, as when we
call a Piece a Gun. The Word Gun was in use in England for an Engine, to
cast a thing from a Man, long before there was any Gun-powder found
out.</p></li>
<li><p>Words must be fitted to a Man’s Mouth; ’twas well said of the
Fellow that was to make a Speech for my Lord Mayor, he desir’d to take
measure of his Lordship’s Mouth.</p></li>
