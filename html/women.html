<p>Women.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LET the Women have power of their heads, because of the Angels.
The reason of the words because of the Angels, is this; The Greek Church
held an Opi∣nion that the Angels fell in Love with Women. This Fancy
St. Paul discreetly catches, and uses it as an Argument to perswade them
to modesty.</p></li>
<li><p>The Grant of a Place is not good by the Canon-Law, before a Man
be dead; upon this ground some Mischief might be plotted against him in
present possession, by poisoning or some other way. Upon the same reason
a Contract made with a Woman, during her Husband’s Life, was not
valid.</p></li>
<li><p>Men are not troubled to hear a Man dispraised, because they know,
tho’ he be naught, there’s worth in others. But Women are mightily
troubled to hear a∣ny of them spoken against, as if the Sex it self were
guilty of some Unworthiness.</p></li>
<li><p>Women and Princes must both trust some body; and they are Happy,
or Un∣happy according to the desert of those under whose Hands they
fall. If a Man knows how to manage the Favour of a Lady, her Honour is
safe, and so is a Princes.</p></li>
<li><p>An Opinion grounded upon that, Genesis 6. The Sons of God saw the
Daugh∣ters of Men that they were fair.</p></li>
