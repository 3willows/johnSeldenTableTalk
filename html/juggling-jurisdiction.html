<p>Juggling.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>’TIS not Juggling that is to be blam’d, but much Juggling, for the
World cannot be Govern’d without it. All your Rhetorick, and all your
Elench’s in Logick come within the com∣pass of Juggling.</li>

<p>Jurisdiction.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THere’s no such Thing as Spiritual Jurisdiction, all is Civil,
the Churche’s is the same with the Lord Mayors. Suppose a Christian came
into a Pagan Country, how can you fancy he shall have any Power there?
he finds faults with the Gods of the Country; well, they will put him to
Death for it: when he is a Martyr, what follows? Does that argue he has
any spiritual Jurisdiction? If the Clergy say the Church ought to be
govern’d thus, and thus, by the Word of God, that is Doctrine all, that
is not Discipline.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pope he challenges Jurisdicti∣on over all, the Bishops they
pretend to it as well as he, the Presbyterians they would have it to
themselves; but over whom is all this? the poor Laymen.</p></li>
