<p>Juggling. 1. ’TIS not Juggling that is to be blam’d, but much
Juggling, for the World cannot be Govern’d without it. All your
Rhetorick, and all your Elench’s in Logick come within the com∣pass of
Juggling.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction. 1. THere’s no such Thing as Spiritual Jurisdiction, all
is Civil, the Churche’s is the same with the Lord Mayors. Suppose a
Christian came into a Pagan Country, how can you fancy he shall have any
Power there? he finds faults with the Gods of the Country; well, they
will put him to Death for it: when he is a Martyr, what follows? Does
that argue he has any spiritual Jurisdiction? If the Clergy say the
Church ought to be govern’d thus, and thus, by the Word of God, that is
Doctrine all, that is not Discipline.</p>

<li>The Pope he challenges Jurisdicti∣on over all, the Bishops they
pretend to it as well as he, the Presbyterians they would have it to
themselves; but over whom is all this? the poor Laymen.</li>
