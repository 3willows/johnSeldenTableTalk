<p>High Commission.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MEN cry out upon the High Com∣mission, as if the Clergy-Men only had
to do in it, when I believe there are more Lay-Men in Commission there,
than Clergy-Men; if the Lay-Men will not come, whose Fault is that? So
of the Star-Chamber, the People think the Bishops only censur’d Prin,
Burton, and Bastwick, when there were but two there, and one spake not
in his own Cause.</li>
</ol>
<p>House of Commons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THere be but two Erroneous Opi∣nions in the House of Commons,
That the Lords sit only for themselves, when the Truth is, they sit as
well for the Common-wealth. The Knights and Burgesses sit for themselves
and others, some for more, some for fewer, and what is the Reason?
because the Room will not hold all; the Lords being few, they all come,
and imagine the Room able to hold all the Commons of Eng∣land, then the
Lords and Burgesses would sit no otherwise than the Lords do. The second
Error is, that the House of Com∣mons are to begin to give Subsidies, yet
if the Lords dissent they can give no Money.</p></li>
<li><p>The House of Commons is called the Lower House, in twenty Acts of
Par∣liament, but what are twenty Acts of Parliament amongst
Friends?</p></li>
<li><p>The Form of a Charge runs thus, I Accuse in the Name of all the
Commons of England, how then can any Man be as a Witness, when every Man
is made the Accuser?</p></li>
