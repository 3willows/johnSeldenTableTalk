<p>Baptism.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>’TWas a good way to persuade Men to be christned, to tell them
that they had a Foulness about them, viz. Original Sin, that could not
be washed away but by Baptism.</p></li>
<li><p>The Baptising of Children with us, does only prepare a Child
against he comes to be a Man, to understand what Christianity means. In
the Church of Rome, it has this Effect, it frees Children from Hell.
They say they go into Lim∣bus Infantum. It succeeds Circumcision, and we
are sure the Child understood nothing of that at eight Days old; why
then may not we as reasonably baptise a Child at that Age? in England of
late years I ever thought the Parson baptiz’d his own Fingers rather
than the Child.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Primitive Times they had God-fathers to see the Children
brought up in the Christian Religion, because ma∣ny times, when the
Father was a Chri∣stia• the Mother was not, and some∣times, when the
Mother was a Christian, the Father was not, and therefore they made
choice of two or more that were Christians, to see their Children
brought up in that Faith.</p></li>
