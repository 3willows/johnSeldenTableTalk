<p>Learning.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>NO Man is the wiser for his Learn∣ing; it may administer Matter
to work in, or Objects to work upon, but Wit and Wisdom are born with a
Man.</p></li>
<li><p>Most Mens Learning is nothing but History duly taken up. If I
quote Tho∣mas Aquinus for some Tenant, and be∣lieve it, because the
School-Men say so, that is but History. Few Men make them∣selves Masters
of things they write or speak.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jesuites and the Lawyers of France, and the Low-Country-Men,
have engrossed all Learning. The rest of the World make nothing but
Homilies.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis observable, that in Athens where the Arts flourisht, they
were govern’d by a Democrasie; Learning made them think themselves as
wise as any body, and they would govern as well as others; and they
speak as it were by way of Con∣tempt, that in the East, and in the North
they had Kings, and why? Because the most part of them followed their
Busi∣ness, and if some one Man had made himself wiser than the rest, he
govern’d them, and they willingly submitted them∣selves to him.
Aristotle makes the Ob∣servation. And as in Athens the Philoso∣phers
made the People knowing, and therefore they thought themselves wise
enough to govern; so does preaching with us, and that makes us affect a
Democra∣sie: For upon these two Grounds we all would be Governours,
either be∣cause we think our selves as wise as the best, or because we
think our selves the Elect, and have the Spirit, and the rest a Company
of Reprobates that belong to the Devil.</p></li>
