<p>Sacrament.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>CHrist suffered Judas to take the Communion. Those Ministers that
keep their Parishioners from it, because they will not do as they will
have them, revenge, rather than reform.</p></li>
<li><p>No Man can tell whether I am fit to receive the Sacrament; for
though I were fit the Day before, when he examin∣ed me; at least
appear’d so to him; yet how can he tell, what Sin I have committed that
Night, or the next Morning, or what Impious Atheistical Thoughts I may
have about me, when I am approaching to the very Table?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Salvation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>VVE can best understand the mean∣ing of 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉,
Salvation, from the Jews, to whom the Saviour was pro∣mised. They held
that themselves should have the chief Place of Happiness in the other
World; but the Gentiles that were good Men, should likewise have their
Portion of Bliss there too. Now by Christ the Partition-Wall is broken
down, and the Gentiles that be∣lieve in him, are admitted to the same
Place of Bliss with the Jews: and why then should not that Portion of
Happi∣ness still remain to them, who do not be∣lieve in Christ, so they
be morally Good? This is a charitable Opinion.</li>
