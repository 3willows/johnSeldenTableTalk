<p>Presbytery.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THey that would bring in a new Government, would very fain
perswade us, they meet it in Antiquity. thus they interpret Presbyters,
when they meet the word in the Fathers: Other professions likewise
pretend to Antiquity. The Alchymist will find his Art in Vir∣gil’s
Aureus ramus, and he that delights in Opticks will find them in Tacitus.
When Caesar came into England they would per∣swade us, they had
Perspective-Glasses, by which he could discover what they were doing
upon the Land, because it is said, Positis Speculis: the meaning is, His
Watch or his Sentinel discover’d this, and this, unto him.</p></li>
<li><p>Presbyters have the greatest power of any Clergy in the World,
and gull the Laity most: For Example; admit there be twelve Laymen to
six Presby∣ters, the six shall govern the rest as they please. First
because they are constant, and the others come in like Church-War∣dens
in their turns, which is an huge</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Advantage, Men will give way to them who have been in place before
them. Next the Laymen have other professions to follow: the Presbyters
make it their sole Business; and besides too, they learn and study the
Art of perswading; some of Geneva have confess’d as much.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The Presbyter with his Elders a∣bout him, is like a young Tree
fenc’d a∣bout with two, or three, or four Stakes; the Stakes defend it,
and hold it up; but the Tree only prospers and flourishes; it may be
some Willow Stake may bear a Leaf or two, but it comes to nothing.
Lay-Elders are Stakes, the Presbyter the Tree that flourshes.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Queries were sent to the Assembly concerning the Jus
Divinum of Presbytery, their asking time to an∣swer them, was a Satyr
upon themselves: For if it were to be seen in the Text, they might
quickly turn to the place, and shew us it. Their delaying to answer
makes us think there’s no such thing there. They do just as you have
seen a fellow do at a Tavern Reckoning, when he should come to pay his
Reckoning, he puts his Hands into his Pockets, and keeps a grabling and
a fumbling, and shaking, at last tells you he has left his Money at
home, when all the Company knew at first, he had no Money there; for
every Man can quickly find his own Money.</p></li>
