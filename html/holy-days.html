<p>Holy-Days.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THey say the Church imposes Holy-Days, there’s no such thing, tho’
the Number of Holy-days is set down in some of our Common-Prayer Books.
Yet that has relation to an Act of Parliament, which forbids the keeping
of any Holy-Days in time of Popery; but those that are kept, are kept by
the Custom of the Country, and I hope you will not say the Church
imposes that.</li>
