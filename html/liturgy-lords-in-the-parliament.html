<p>Liturgy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THere is no Church without a Li∣turgy, nor indeed can there be
conveniently, as there is no School with∣out a Grammar. One Scholar may
be taught otherwise upon the Stock of his Acumen, but not a whole
School. One or Two, that are piously dispos’d, may serve themselves
their own Way, but hard∣ly a whole Nation.</p></li>
<li><p>To know what was generally be∣liev’d in all Ages, the way is to
consult the Liturgies, not any private Man’s writ∣ing. As if you would
know how the Church of England serves God, go to the Common-Prayer-Book,
consult not this nor that Man. Besides, Liturgies ne∣ver Complement, nor
use high Expressi∣ons. The Fathers oft-times speak
Ora∣toriously.</p></li>

<p>Lords in the Parliament.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Lords giving Protections is a scorn upon them. A Protection
means nothing actively, but passively; he that is a Servant to a
Parliament-Man is thereby protected. What a Scorn is it to a Person of
Honour, to put his Hand to two Lyes at once, that such a Man is my
Servant, and employ’d by me, when haply he never saw the Man in his
Life, nor before never heard of him.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lords protesting is Foolish. To protest is properly to save
to a Man’s self some Right; but to protest as the Lords protest, when
they their selves are in∣volv’d, ’tis no more than if I should go into
Smithfield, and sell my Horse, and take the Money, and yet when I have
your Money, and you my Horse, I should pro∣test this Horse is mine,
because I love the Horse, or I do not know why I do protest, because my
Opinion is contrary to the rest. Ridiculous, when they say the Bishops
did antiently protest, it was only dissenting, and that in the Case of
the Pope.</p></li>
