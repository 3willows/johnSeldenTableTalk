<p>Proverbs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THE Proverbs of several Nations were much studied by Bishop
An∣drews, and the Reason he gave, was, Be∣cause by them he knew the
Minds of se∣veral Nations, which is a brave thing; as we count him a
wise Man, that knows the minds and insides of Men, which is done by
knowing what is habitual to them. Proverbs are habitual to a Nati∣on,
being transmitted from Father to Son.</li>

<p>Question.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>WHen a doubt is propounded, you must learn to distinguish, and show
wherein a thing holds, and wherein it doth not hold: Ay, or no, never
answer’d any Question. The not distinguishing where things should be
di∣stinguish’d, and the not confounding, where things should be
confounded, is the cause of all the Mistakes in the World.</li>
