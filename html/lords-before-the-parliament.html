<p>Lords before the Parliament. 1. GReat Lords by reason of their
Flat∣terers, are the first that know their own Vertues, and the last
that know their own Vices: Some of them are a∣sham’d upwards, because
their Ancestors were too great. Others are ashamed down∣wards, because
they were too little.</p>

<li><p>The Prior of St. John of Jerusalem, is said to be Primus Baro
Angliae, the first Baron of England, because being last of the Spiritual
Barons, he chose to be first of the Temporal. He was a kind of an Otter,
a Knight half Spiritual, and half Temporal.</p></li>
<li><p>Quest. Whether is every Baron a Ba∣ron of some Place?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Answ. ’Tis according to his Patent; of late Years they have been made
Baron of some Place, but antiently not, call’d only by their Sir-Name,
or the Sir-Name of some Family, into which they have been married.</p>

<li><p>The making of new Lords lessens all the rest. ’Tis in the
business of Lords, as it ’twas with St. Nicolas’s Image: The
Country-Man, you know, could not find in his Heart to adore the new
Image, made of his own Plum-Tree, though he had formerly worship’d the
old one. The Lords that are antient we honour, because we know not
whence they come; but the new ones we slight, because we know their
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>For the Irish Lords to take upon them here in England, is as if
the Cook in the Fair should come to my Lady Kent’s Kitchen, and take
upon him to roast the Meat there, because he is a Cook in another
place.</p></li>
