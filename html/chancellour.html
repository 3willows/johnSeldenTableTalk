<p>Chancellour.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Bishop is not to sit with a Chancellor in his Court (as being
a thing either beneath him or beside him) no more than the King is to
sit in the King’s-Bench when he has made a Lord-Chief-Justice.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chancellour govern’d in the Church, who was a Lay-man: And
therefore ’tis false which they charge the Bishops with, that they
challenge sole Jurisdiction: For the Bishop can no more put out the
Chancellor than the Chan∣cellor the Bishop. They were many of them made
Chancellors for their Lives, and he is the fittest Man to go∣vern,
because Divinity so overwhelms the rest.</p></li>
