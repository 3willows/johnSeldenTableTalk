<p>Praemunire.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THere can be no Praemunire. A Praemunire (so call’d from the word
Praemunire facias) was when a Man laid an Action in an Ecclesiastical
Court, for which he could have no remedy in any of the King’s Courts;
that is, in the Courts of Common Law, by reason the Eccle∣siastical
Courts before Henry the Eighth were subordinate to the Pope, and so it
was contra coronam &amp; dignitatem Regis; but now the Ecclesiastical
Courts are equally subordinate to the King. There∣fore it cannot be
contra coronam &amp; dig∣nitatem Regis, and so no Praemunire.</li>

<p>Prerogative.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>PRerogative is something that can be told what it is, not
something that has no Name. Just as you see the Archbishop has his
Prerogative Court, but we know what is done in that Court. So the King’s
Prerogative is not his will, or what Divines make it a power, to do what
he lists.</p></li>
<li><p>The King’s Prerogative, that is, the King’s Law. For example, if
you ask whether a Patron may present to a Living after six Months by
Law? I answer no. If you ask whether the King may? I an∣swer he may by
his Prerogative, that is by the Law that concerns him in that
case.</p></li>
