<p>Parson.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THough we write [Parson] different∣ly, yet ’tis but Person; that
is, the individual Person set apart for the Service of such a Church,
and ’tis in La∣tin Persona, and Personatus is a Personage. Indeed with
the Canon-Lawyers, Perso∣natus is any Dignity or Perferment in the
Church.</p></li>
<li><p>There never was a merry World since the Faries left Dancing, and
the Parson left Conjuring. The Opinion of the latter kept Thieves in aw,
and did as much good in a Country as a Ju∣stice of Peace.</p></li>
