<p>Christians. 1. IN the High-Church of Jerusalem, the Christians were
but another Sect of Jews, that did believe the Messias was come. To be
called, was nothing else, but to become a Christian, to have the Name of
a Christian, it being their own Language: For among the Jews, when they
made a Doctor of Law, ’twas said he was called.</p>

<li><p>The Turks tell their People of a Heaven where there is sensible
Pleasure, but of a Hell where they shall suffer they don’t know what.
The Christians quite invert this Order, they tell us of a Hell where we
shall feel sensible Pain, but of a Heaven where we shall enjoy we can’t
tell what.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the Heathens object to the Christians, that they worship
an Asses Head? You must know, that to a Hea∣then, a Jew and a Christian
were all one, that they regarded him not, so he was not one of them. Now
that of the Asses Head might proceed from such a Mistake as this; by the
Jews Law, all the Firstlings of Cattle were to be offered to God, except
a young Ass, which was to be redeemed, a Heathen being present, and
seeing young Calves and young Lambs kill’d at their Sacrifices, only
young Asses redeem’d, might very well think they had that silly Beast in
some high Estimation, and thence might imagine they worshipped it as a
God.</p></li>
