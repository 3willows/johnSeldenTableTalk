<p>Epitaph.</p>
<p>AN Epitaph must be made fit for the Person for whom it is made; for a
Man to say all the Excellent things that can be said upon one, and call
that his Epitaph, is as if a Painter should make the handsomest Piece he
can possibly make, and say ’twas my Picture. It holds in a Funeral
Sermon.</p>
