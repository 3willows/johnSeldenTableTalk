<p>Things Indifferent.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>IN time of a Parliament, when things are under debate, they are
indiffe∣rent, but in a Church or State settled, there’s nothing left
indifferent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Publick Interest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ALL might go well in the Com∣mon-Wealth, if every one in the
Parliament would lay down his own In∣terest, and aim at the general
good. If a man were sick, and the whole Col∣ledge of Physicians should
come to him, and administer severally, haply so long as they observ’d
the Rules of Art he might recover, but if one of them had a great deal
of Scamony by him, he must put off that, therefore he prescribes
Sca∣mony. Another had a great deal of Rubarb, and he must put off that,
and therefore he prescribes Rubarb, &amp;c. then would certainly kill
the Man. We de∣stroy the Common-Wealth, while we pre∣serve our own
private Interests, and neg∣lect the publick.</li>
