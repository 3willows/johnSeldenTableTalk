<p>Gold.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THere are two Reasons, why these Words (Jesus autem transiens per
medium eorum ibat) were about our old Gold: the one is, because Riply,
the Al∣chymist, when he made Gold in the Tower, the first time he found
it he spoke these Words [per medium eorum] that is, per medium Ignis
&amp; Sulphuris. The other, because these Words were thought to be a
Charm, and that they did bind whatsoever they were written upon, so that
a Man could not take it away. To this Reason I rather incline.</li>

<p>Hall.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THE Hall was the Place where the great Lord us’d to eat, (where∣fore
else were the Halls made so big?) Where he saw all his Servants and
Te∣nants about him. He eat not in private, except in time of Sickness;
when once he became a thing Coop’d up, all his greatness was
spoil’d. Nay the King him∣self used to eat in the Hall, and his Lords
sate with him, and then he understood Men.</li>
