<li>WHY should I think all the fourth Commandment belongs to me, when
all the fifth does not? What Land will the Lord give me for honouring my
Father? It was spoken to the Jews with reference to the Land of Canaan;
but the meaning is, If I honour my Parents, God will also bless me. We
read the Commandments in the Church-Service, as we do Davidâ€™s Psalms;
not that all there concerns us, but a great deal of them does.</li>
