<p>Measure of Things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WE measure from our selves, and as things are for our use and
purpose, so we approve them. Bring a Pear to the Table that is rotten,
we cry it down, ’tis naught; but bring a Medlar that is rotten, and ’tis
a fine thing, and yet I’ll warrant you the Pear thinks as well of it
self as the Medlar does.</p></li>
<li><p>We measure the Excellency of o∣ther Men, by some Excellency we
con∣ceive to be in our selves. Nash a Poet, poor enough (as Poets us’d
to be) seeing an Alderman with his Gold Chain, upon his great Horse, by
way of scorn, said to one of his Companions, do you see yon Fel∣low, how
goodly, how big he looks; why that Fellow cannot make a blank
Verse.</p></li>
<li><p>Nay we measure the goodness of God from our selves, we measure
his Goodness, his Justice, his Wisdom, by something we call Just, Good,
or Wise in our selves; and in so doing, we judge proportionably to the
Country Fellow in the Play, who said if he were a King, he would live
like a Lord, and have Pease and Bacon every Day, and a Whip that cry’d
Slash.</p></li>
