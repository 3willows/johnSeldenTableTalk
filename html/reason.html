<p>Reason.</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>IN giving Reasons, Men commonly do with us as the Woman does with
      her Child; when she goes to Mar∣ket about her Business, she tells it she
      goes to buy it a fine Thing, to buy it a Cake or some Plums. They give
      us such Reasons as they think we will be catched withal, but never let
      us know the Truth.</p>

  <li>
    <p>When the School-Men talk of Recta Ratio in Morals, either they
      understand Reason as it is govern’d by a Command from above; or else
      they say no more than a Woman, when she says a thing is so, because it
      is so; that is, her Reason per∣swades her ’tis so. The other Acception
      has Sense in it. As take a Law of the Land, I must not depopulate, my
      Rea∣son tells me so. Why? Because if I do, I incurr the
      detriment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reason of a Thing is not to be enquired after, till you are
      sure the Thing it self be so. We commonly are at [What’s the Reason of
      it?] before we are sure of the Thing. ’Twas an excellent Que∣stion of my
      Lady Cotten, when Sir Robert Cotten was magnifying of a Shooe, which was
      Moses’s or Noah’s, and wondring at the strange Shape and Fashion of it:
      But Mr. Cotten, says she, are you sure it is a Shooe.</p>
