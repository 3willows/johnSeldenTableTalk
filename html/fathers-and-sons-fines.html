<p>Fathers and Sons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>IT hath ever been the way for Fa∣thers, to bind their Sons, to
strengthen this by the Law of the Land: every one at Twelve Years of Age
is to take the Oath of Allegiance in Court-Leets, whereby he swears
Obedience to the King.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fines. 1. THe old Law was, that when a Man was Fin’d, he was to be
Fin’d Salvo Con∣teneniento, so as his Countenance might be safe, taking
Countenance in the same sense as your Country-Man does, when he says, if
you will come unto my House, I will shew you the best Countenance I can,
that is not the best Face, but the best Entertain∣ment. The meaning of
the Law was, that so much should be taken from a Man, such a Cobbet
sliced off, that yet not with∣standing he might live in the same Rank
and Condition he lived in before; but now they fine Men ten times more
than they are worth.</p>
