<p>Parity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THis is the Juggling Trick of the Parity, they would have no body
above them, but they do not tell you they would have no body under
them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Parliament.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>ALL are involv’d in a Parliament. There was a time when all Men
had their Voice in choosing Knights. A∣bout Henry the Sixth’s time they
found the inconvenience, so one Parliament made a Law, that only he that
had forty Shillings per annum should give his Voice, they under should
be excluded. They made the Law who had the Voice of all, as well under
forty Shillings; as above; and thus it continues at this Day. All
consent civilly in a Parliament, Women are involv’d in the Men, Children
in those of perfect Age; those that are under forty Shillings a Year, in
those that have forty Shillings a year, those of forty Shillings in the
Knights.</p></li>
<li><p>All things are brought to the Par∣liament, little to the Courts
of Justice: just as in a Room where there is a Ban∣quet presented, if
there be Persons of Quality there, the People must ex∣pect, and stay
till the great ones have done.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament flying upon seve∣ral Men, and then letting them
alone, does as a Hawk that flyes a Covey of Partridges, and when she has
flown them a great way, grows weary, and takes a Tree; then the
Faulconer lures her down, and takes her to his Fist: on they go again,
heirett, upsprings another Co∣vey, away goes the Hawk, and as she did
before, takes another Tree, &amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>Dissenters in Parliament may at length come to a good end, though
first there be a great deal of do, and a great deal of Noise, which mad,
wild Folks make: just as in brewing of Wrest-Beer, there’s a great deal
of Business in grind∣ing the Mault, and that spoils any Man’s Cloaths
that comes near it: then it must be mash’d, then comes a Fellow in and
drinks of the Wort, and he’s drunk; then they keep a huge quarter when
they car∣ry it into the Cellar, and a twelve Month after ’tis delicate
fine Beer.</p></li>
<li><p>It must necessarily be that our Di∣stempers are worse than they
were in the beginning of the Parliament. If a Physi∣cian comes to a sick
Man, he lets him Blood, it may be scarifyes him, cups him, puts him into
a great disorder, before he makes him well; and if he be sent for to
cure an Ague, and he finds his Patient hath many Diseases, a Dropsie,
and a Pal∣sie, he applies Remedies to ’em all, which makes the cure the
longer and the dearer: this is the Case.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament-men are as great Princes as any in the World, when
what∣soever they please is priviledge of Parlia∣ment; no Man must know
the num∣ber of their Priviledges, and whatsoever they dislike is breach
of Priviledge. The Duke of Venice is no more than Speaker of the House
of Commons; but the Se∣nate at Venice, are not so much as our
Parliament-men, nor have they that Pow∣er over the People, who yet
exercise the greatest Tyranny that is any where. In plain truth, breach
of Priviledge is only the actual taking away of a Member of the House,
the rest are Offences against the House. For Example, to take our
Pro∣cess against a Parliament-man, or the like.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament Party, if the Law be for them, they call for the
Law; if it be against them, they will go to a Par∣liamentary Way; if no
Law be for them, then for Law again: Like him that first call’d for Sack
to heat him, then small Drink to cool his Sack, then Sack again to heat
his small Drink, &amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament Party doe not play fair Play, in sitting up till
two of the Clock in the Morning, to vote something they have a mind to.
’Tis like a craf∣ty Gamester, that makes the Company drunk, then cheats
them of their Money.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Young Men, and infirm Men go away; besides, a Man is not there to
persuade other Men to be of his mind, but to speak his own Heart, and if
it be lik’d, so, if not, there’s an end.</p>
