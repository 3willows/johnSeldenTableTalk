<p>Confession. 1. IN time of Parliament it used to be one of the first
things the House did, to Petition the King that his Con∣fessor might be
removed, as fearing ei∣ther his Power with the King, or else, lest he
should reveal to the Pope what the House was in doing, as no doubt he
did when the Catholick Cause was concerned.</p>

<li><p>The Difference between us and the Papists is, we both allow
Contrition, but the Papists make Confession a part of Contrition; they
say a Man is not suffici∣ently contrite, till he confess his Sins to a
Priest.</p></li>
<li><p>Why should I think a Priest will not reveal Confession, I am sure
he will do any thing that is forbidden him, haply not so often as I, the
utmost Pu∣nishment is Deprivation; and how can it be proved, that ever
any Man revealed Confession, when there is no Witness? And no Man can be
Witness in his own Cause. A meer Gullery. There was a time when ’twas
publick in the Church, and that is much against their Auricular
Confession.</p></li>

<p>Competency.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THat which is a Competency for one Man, is not enough for ano∣ther,
no more than that which will keep one Man warm, will keep another Man
warm; one Man can go in Doublet and Hose, when another Man cannot be
with∣out a Cloak, and yet have no more Cloaths than is necessary for
him.</li>

<p>Great Conjunction. THE greatest Conjunction of Satan and Jupiter,
happens but once in eight Hundred Years, and therefore Astro∣logers can
make no Experiments of it, nor foretel what it means, (not but that the
Stars may mean something, but we cannot tell what) because we cannot
come at them. Suppose a Planet were a Simple, or an Herb, how could a
Phy∣sician tell the Vertue of that Simple, un∣less he could come at it,
to apply it?</p>
<p>Conscience. 1. HE that hath a Scrupulous Consci∣ence, is like a Horse
that is not well weigh’d, he starts at every Bird that flies out of the
Hedge.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>A knowing Man will do that, which a tender Conscience Man dares
not do, by reason of his Ignorance, the other knows there is no hurt, as
a Child is afraid to go into the dark, when a Man is not, because he
knows there is no Danger.</p></li>
<li><p>If we once come to leave that out∣loose, as to pretend Conscience
against Law, who knows what inconvenience may follow? For thus, Suppose
an Anabaptist comes and takes my Horse, I Sue him, he tells me he did
according to his Conscience, his Conscience tells him all things are
com∣mon amongst the Saints, what is mine is his; therefore you do ill to
make such a Law, If any Man takes another’s Horse he shall be
hang’d. What can I say to this Man? He does according to his
Con∣science. Why is not he as honest a Man as he that pretends a
Ceremony establish’d by Law, is against his Conscience? Ge∣nerally to
pretend Conscience against Law, is dangerous, in some Cases haply we
may.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Men make it a Case of Con∣science, whether a Man may have a
Pidgeon-House, because his Pidgeons eat other Folks Corn. But there is
no such thing as Conscience in the Business, the Matter is, whether he
be a Man of such Quality, that the State allows him to have a
Dove-House, if so, there’s an end of the Business, his Pidgeons have a
right to eat where they please them∣selves.</p></li>
