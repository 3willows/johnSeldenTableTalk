<p>Excommunication.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THat place they bring for Excom∣munication [put away from a∣mong
your selves that wicked Person, 1 Cor. 5. Cha. 13. Verse.] is corrupted
in the Greek for it should be, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, put away
that Evil from among you, not 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, that Evil
Person, besides, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, is the Devil in Scripture,
and it may be so taken there; and there is a new Edition of Theodoret
come out, that has it right 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, ’Tis true the
Christians before the Civil State became Christian, did by Covenant and
Agreement set down how they should live, and he that did not observe
what they agreed upon, should come no more amongst them, that is, be
Excommunicated. Such Men are spoken of by the Apostle [Romans 1. 31.]
whom he calls 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, the Vulgar has it,
Incomposit, &amp; sine faedre, the last Word is pretty well, but the
first not at all; Origen in his Book against Celsus, speaks of the
Christians, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉: the Translation renders it
Conventus, as it signifies a Meeting, when it is plain it signifies a
Covenant, and the English Bi∣ble turned the other Word well,
Cove∣nant-breakers. Pliny tells us, the Chri∣stians took an Oath amongst
themselves to live thus, and thus.</p></li>
<li><p>The other place [Dic Ecclesiae] tell the Church, is but a weak
Ground to raise Excommunication upon, especially from the Sacrament, the
lesser Excommu∣nication, since when that was spoken, the Sacrament was
instituted. The Jews Ec∣clesia was their Sanhedrim; their Court: so that
the meaning is, if after once or twice Admonition, this Brother will not
be reclaim’d, bring him thither.</p></li>
<li><p>The first Excommunication was 180 Years after Christ, and that by
Victor, Bi∣shop of Rome: But that was no more than this, that they
should Communicate and receive the Sacrament amongst themselves, not
with those of the other Opinion: The Controversie (as I take it) being
about the Feast of Easter. Men do not care for Excommunication, because
they are shut out of the Church, or delivered up to Satan, but because
the Law of the King∣dom takes hold of them, after so many Days a Man
cannot Sue, no not for his Wife, if you take her from him; and there may
be as much reason, to grant it for a small Fault, if there be
contuma∣cy, as for a great one. In Wectminster-Hall you may Out-law a
Man for forty Shillings, which is their Excommunicati∣on, and you can do
no more for Forty Thousand Pound.</p></li>
<li><p>When Constantine became Christian, he so fell in love with the
Clergy, that he let them be Judges of all things; but that continued not
above three or four Years, by reason they were to be Judges of Matters
they understood not, and then they were allowed to meddle with no∣thing
but Religion; all Jurisdiction be∣longed to him, and he scanted them out
as much as he pleas’d, and so things have since continued. They
Excommunicate for three or four Things, Matters con∣cerning Adultery,
Tythes, Wills, &amp;c. which is the civil Punishment the State allows
for such Faults. If a Bishop Ex∣communicate a Man for what he ought not,
the Judge has Power to absolve and punish the Bishop: if they had that
Juris∣diction from God, why does not the Church Excommunicate for
Murder, for Theft? If the Civil Power might take away all but three
Things, why may they not take them away too? If this Excom∣munication
were taken away, the Presby∣ters would be quiet; ’tis that they have a
mind to, ’tis that they would fain be at. Like the Wench that was to be
Married; she ask’d her Mother when ’twas done, if she should go to Bed
presently: no, says her Mother, you must dine first, and then to Bed
Mother? no you must dance after Dinner, and then to Bed Mother? no, you
must go to Sup∣per, and then to Bed Mother, &amp;c.</p></li>
