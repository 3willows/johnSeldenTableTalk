<p>Clergy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THough a Clergy-man have no Faults of his own, yet the Faults of
the whole Tribe shall be laid upon him, so that he shall be sure not to
lack.</p></li>
<li><p>The Clergy would have us believe them against our own Reason, as
the Wo∣man would have had her Husband against his own Eyes: What! will
you believe your own Eyes before your own sweet Wife.</p></li>
<li><p>The Condition of the Clergy to∣wards their Prince, and the
Condition of the Physician is all one: The Physicians tell the Prince
they have Agaric and Ru∣barb, good for him, and good for his Sub∣jects
Bodies; upon this he gives them leave to use it; but if it prove naught,
then away with it, they shall use it no more: So the Clergy tell the
Prince they have Physick good for his Soul, and good for the Souls of
his People; upon that he admits them: But when he finds by Ex∣perience
they both trouble him and his People, he will have no more to do with
them, what is that to them, or any body else, if a King will not go to
Heaven.</p></li>
<li><p>A Clergy-man goes not a Dram further than this, you ought to obey
your Prince in general; [if he does he is lost] how to obey him, you
must be inform’d by those whose Profession it is to tell you. The Parson
of the Tower (a good discreet Man) told Dr. Mosely, (who was sent to me
and the rest of the Gentlemen committed the 3d Caroli, to persuade us to
submit to the King) that they found no such Words as [Parlia∣ment,
Habeas Corpus, Return, Tower, &amp;c.] Neither in the Fathers, nor the
School∣men, nor in the Text; and therefore for his part he believed he
understood no∣thing of the Business. A Satyr upon all those Clergy-men
that meddle with Mat∣ters they do not understand.</p></li>
<li><p>All confess there never was a more learned Clergy, no Man taxes
them with Ignorance. But to talk of that, is like the Fellow that was a
great Wencher; he wish’d God would forgive him his Leachery, and lay
Usury to his Charge. The Clergy have worse Faults.</p></li>
<li><p>The Clergy and Laity together are never like to do well, ’tis as
if a Man were to make an excellent Feast, and should have his Apothecary
and his Physician come into the Kitchen: The Cooks if they were let
alone would make excellent Meat, but then comes the Apothecary and he
puts Rubarb into one Sauce and Agrick into another Sauce. Chain up the
Clergy on both sides.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>High Commission.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MEN cry out upon the High Com∣mission, as if the Clergy-Men only had
to do in it, when I believe there are more Lay-Men in Commission there,
than Clergy-Men; if the Lay-Men will not come, whose Fault is that? So
of the Star-Chamber, the People think the Bishops only censur’d Prin,
Burton, and Bastwick, when there were but two there, and one spake not
in his own Cause.</li>
</ol>
<p>House of Commons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THere be but two Erroneous Opi∣nions in the House of Commons,
That the Lords sit only for themselves, when the Truth is, they sit as
well for the Common-wealth. The Knights and Burgesses sit for themselves
and others, some for more, some for fewer, and what is the Reason?
because the Room will not hold all; the Lords being few, they all come,
and imagine the Room able to hold all the Commons of Eng∣land, then the
Lords and Burgesses would sit no otherwise than the Lords do. The second
Error is, that the House of Com∣mons are to begin to give Subsidies, yet
if the Lords dissent they can give no Money.</p></li>
<li><p>The House of Commons is called the Lower House, in twenty Acts of
Par∣liament, but what are twenty Acts of Parliament amongst
Friends?</p></li>
<li><p>The Form of a Charge runs thus, I Accuse in the Name of all the
Commons of England, how then can any Man be as a Witness, when every Man
is made the Accuser?</p></li>
