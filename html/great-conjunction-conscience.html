<p>Great Conjunction.</p>
<p>THE greatest Conjunction of Satan and Jupiter, happens but once in
  eight Hundred Years, and therefore Astro∣logers can make no Experiments
  of it, nor foretel what it means, (not but that the Stars may mean
  something, but we cannot tell what) because we cannot come at them.
  Suppose a Planet were a Simple, or an Herb, how could a Phy∣sician tell
  the Vertue of that Simple, un∣less he could come at it, to apply it?</p>
<p>Conscience. 1. HE that hath a Scrupulous Consci∣ence, is like a Horse
  that is not well weigh’d, he starts at every Bird that flies out of the
  Hedge.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>A knowing Man will do that, which a tender Conscience Man dares
      not do, by reason of his Ignorance, the other knows there is no hurt, as
      a Child is afraid to go into the dark, when a Man is not, because he
      knows there is no Danger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we once come to leave that out∣loose, as to pretend Conscience
      against Law, who knows what inconvenience Page 42</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>may follow? For thus, Suppose an Anabaptist comes and takes my Horse,
  I Sue him, he tells me he did according to his Conscience, his
  Conscience tells him all things are com∣mon amongst the Saints, what is
  mine is his; therefore you do ill to make such a Law, If any Man takes
  another’s Horse he shall be hang’d. What can I say to this Man? He does
  according to his Con∣science. Why is not he as honest a Man as he that
  pretends a Ceremony establish’d by Law, is against his Conscience?
  Ge∣nerally to pretend Conscience against Law, is dangerous, in some
  Cases haply we may.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>Some Men make it a Case of Con∣science, whether a Man may have a
    Pidgeon-House, because his Pidgeons eat other Folks Corn. But there is
    no such thing as Conscience in the Business, the Matter is, whether he
    be a Man of such Quality, that the State allows him to have a
    Dove-House, if so, there’s an end of the Business, his Pidgeons have a
    right to eat where they please them∣selves.</li>
