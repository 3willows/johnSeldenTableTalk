<p>Great Conjunction.</p>
<p>THE greatest Conjunction of Satan and Jupiter, happens but once in
eight Hundred Years, and therefore Astro∣logers can make no Experiments
of it, nor foretel what it means, (not but that the Stars may mean
something, but we cannot tell what) because we cannot come at them.
Suppose a Planet were a Simple, or an Herb, how could a Phy∣sician tell
the Vertue of that Simple, un∣less he could come at it, to apply it?</p>
