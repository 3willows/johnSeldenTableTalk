<p>Popery.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE demanding a Noble, for a dead body passing through a a Town,
came from hence in time of Popery, they carried the dead Body into the
Church, where the Priest said Dir∣gies; and twenty Dirgies at four Pence
a piece, comes to a Noble; but now it is forbidden by an Order from my
Lord Marshal, the Heralds carry his Warrant about them.</p></li>
<li><p>We charge the Prelatical Clergy with Popery, to make them odious,
tho’ we know they are guilty of no such thing: Just as heretofore they
call’d Ima∣ges Mammets, and the Adoration of Ima∣ges Mammetry: that is,
Mahomet and Ma∣hometry; odious Names, when all the World knows the Turks
are forbidden I∣mages by their Religion.</p></li>
