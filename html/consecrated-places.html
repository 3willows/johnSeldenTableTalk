<p>Consecrated Places. 1. THE Jews had a peculiar way of consecrating
things to God, which we have not.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Under the Law, God, who was Master of all, made choice of a
Tem∣ple to worship in, where he was more especially present: Just as the
Master of the House, who owns all the House, makes choice of one Chamber
to lie in, which is called the Master’s Chamber; but un∣der the Gospel
there was no such thing, Temples and Churches are set apart for the
conveniency of Men to Worship in; they cannot meet upon the Point of a
Needle, but God himself makes no choice.</p></li>
<li><p>All things are Gods already, we can give him no right by
consecrating any, that he had not before, only we set it apart to his
Service. Just as a Gardiner brings his Lord and Master a Basket of
Apri∣cocks, and presents them, his Lord thanks him, perhaps gives him
something for his Pains, and yet the Apricocks were as much his Lord’s
before as now.</p></li>
<li><p>What is Consecrated, is given to some particular man, to do God
Service, not given to God, but given to Man, to serve God: And there’s
not any thing, Lands, or Goods, but some Men or other have it in their
Power, to dispose of as they please. The saying things Consecrated
cannot be taken away, makes men afraid of Consecration.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet Consecration has this Power, when a Man has Consecrated any
thing to God, he cannot of himself take it a∣way.</p></li>
