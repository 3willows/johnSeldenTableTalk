<p>Priests of Rome.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Reason of the Statute against Priests, was this; In the
begin∣ning of Queen Elizabeth there was a Statute made, that he that
drew Men from their civil Obedience was a Traitor. It happen’d this was
done in privacies and confessions, when there could be no proof;
therefore they made another Act, that for a Priest to be in England was
Treason, because they presum’d that was his busi∣ness to fetch Men off
from their Obe∣dience.</p></li>
<li><p>When Queen Elizabeth dy’d, and King James came in, an Irish
Priest does thus express it: Elizabetha in orcum de∣trusa, successit
Jacobus alter Haereticus. You will ask why they did use such Language in
their Church. Answ. Why does the Nurse tell the Child of raw Head and
bloody Bones, to keep it in awe?</p></li>
<li><p>The Queen Mother and Count Ros∣set, are to the Priests and
Jesuits like the Honey Pot to the Flies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Priests of Rome aim but at two Things, to get Power from the
King, and Money from the Subject.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Priests come into a Fa∣mily, they do as a Man that would
set fire on a House; he does not put fire to the Brick-Wall, but thrusts
it into the Thatch. They work upon the Women, and let the Men
alone.</p></li>
<li><p>For a Priest to turn a Man when he lies a dying, is just like one
that hath a long time solicited a Woman, and can∣not obtain his end; at
length makes her drunk, and so lies with her.</p></li>
