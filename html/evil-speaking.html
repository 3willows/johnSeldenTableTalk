<p>Evil Speaking.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>HE that speaks ill of another com∣monly before he is aware, makes
himself such a one as he speaks against; for if he had Civility or
Breeding he would forbear such kind of Language.</p></li>
<li><p>A gallant Man is above ill Words: an Exemple we have in the old
Lord of Salisbury (who was a great wise Man) Stone had call’d some Lord
about Court, Fool, the Lord complains, and has Stone whipt; Stones
cries, I might have called my Lord of Salisbury Fool often enough,
before he would have had me whipt.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak not ill of a great Enemy, but rather give him good Words,
that he may use you the better, if you chance to fall into his Hands:
the Spaniard did this when he was dying; his Confessor told him (to work
him to Repentance) how the Devil tormented the wicked that went to Hell:
the Spaniard replying, called the Devil my Lord. I hope my Lord the
Devil is not so cruel, his Confessor reproved him. Excuse me said the
Don, for calling him so, I know not into what Hands I may fall, and if I
happen into his, I hope he will use me the better for giving him good
words.</p></li>
