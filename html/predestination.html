<p>Predestination.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THey that talk nothing but Pre∣destination, and will not pro∣ceed
in the way of Heaven till they be satisfied in that point, do, as a Man
that would not come to London, unless at his first step he might set his
Foot upon the Top of Pauls.</p></li>
<li><p>For a young Divine to begin in his Pulpit with Predestination, is
as if a Man were coming into London, and at his first Step would think
to set his Foot, &amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>Predestination is a point inaccessible, out of our reach; we can
make no notion of it, ’tis so full of Intricacy, so full of
Con∣tradiction; ’tis in good earnest, as we state it, half a Dozen Bulls
one upon another.</p></li>
<li><p>Doctor Prideaux, in his Lectures, several Days us’d Arguments to
prove Predestination; at last tells his Auditory they are damn’d that do
not believe it. Doing herein just like School-Boys, when one of them has
got an Apple, or some∣thing the rest have a mind to, they use all the
Arguments they can to get some of it from them: I gave you some t’other
Day: You shall have some with me another time: When they cannot prevail,
they tell him he’s a Jackanapes, a Rogue and a Rascal,</p></li>
