<p>Truth.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Aristotelians say, All Truth is contained in Aristotle in one
place or another. Galilaeo makes Simpli∣cius say so, but shows the
absurdity of that Speech, by answering, All Truth is contained in a
lesser Compass; viz. In the Alphabet. Aristotle is not blam’d for
mi∣staking sometimes; but Aristotelians for maintaining those Mistakes.
They should acknowledge the good they have from him, and leave him when
he is in the wrong. There never breath’d that Per∣son to whom Mankind
was more be∣holden.</p></li>
<li><p>The way to find out the Truth is by others mistakings: For if I
was to go to such a place, and one had gone be∣fore me on the
Right-hand, and he was out; another had gone on the Left-hand, and he
was out; this would direct me to keep the middle way, that peradven∣ture
would bring me to the place I de∣sir’d to go.</p></li>
<li><p>In troubled Water you can scarce see your Face; or see it very
little, till the Water be quiet and stand still. So in troubled times
you can see little Truth; when times are quiet and settled, then Truth
appears;</p></li>
