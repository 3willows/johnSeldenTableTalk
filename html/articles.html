<p>Articles.</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>THE nine and thirty Articles are much another thing in Latin, (in
    which Tongue they were made) than they are translated into English; they
    were made at three several Convocations, and confirmed by Act of
    Parliament six or seven Times after. There is a Secret concerning them:
    Of late Ministers have subscribed to all of them, but by Act of
    Parliament that confirm’d them, they ought only to subscribe to those
    Arti∣cles which contain matter of Faith, and the Doctrine of the
    Sacraments, as ap∣pears by the first Subscriptions. But Bisho•Bancroft
    (in the Convocation held in King Jame’s days) he began it, that
    Ministers should subscribe to three Things, to the King’s Supremacy, to
    the Common-Prayer, and to the Thirty Nine Articles; many of them do not
    contain matter of Faith. Is it matter of Faith how the Church should be
    govern’d? Whether Infants should be baptized? Whether we have any
    Property in our Goods? &amp;c.</li>
