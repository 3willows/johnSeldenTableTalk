<p>Superstition.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THey that are against Superstition oftentimes run into it of the
wrong side. If I will wear all colours but black, then am I
superstitious in not wearing black.</p></li>
<li><p>They pretend not to abide the Cross, because ’tis superstitious;
for my part I will believe them, when I see them throw their Money out
of their Pockets, and not tell then.</p></li>
<li><p>If there be any Superstition truly and properly so called, ’tis
their obser∣ving the Sabbòth after the Jewish Man∣ner.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Subsidies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>HEretofore the Parliament was wa∣ry what Subsidies they gave to
the King, because they had no account; but now they care not how much
they give of the Subjects Money, because they give it with one hand, and
receive it with the other; and so upon the matter give it themselves. In
the mean time what a case the Subjects of England are in; if the Men
they have sent to the Parliament mis-behave themselves, they cannot help
it, because the Parliament is Eternal.</p></li>
<li><p>A Subsidy was counted the fifth part of a Man’s Estate, and so
fifty Sub∣sidies is five and forty times more than a Man is
Worth.</p></li>
