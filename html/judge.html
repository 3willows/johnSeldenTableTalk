<p>Judge.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WE see the Pageants in Cheapside, the Lions, and the Elephants,
but we do not see the Men that carry them; we see the Judges look big,
look like Lions, but we do not see who moves them.</p></li>
<li><p>Little things do great works, when the great things will not. If
I should take a Pin from the Ground, a little pair of Tongues will do
it, when a great Pair will not. Go to a Judge to do a Busi∣ness for you,
by no means he will not hear of it; but go to some small Servant about
him, and he will dispatch it ac∣cording to your hearts desire.</p></li>
<li><p>There could be no Mischief in the Common-Wealth without a Judge.
Tho’ there be false Dice brought in at the Groom-Porters, and cheating
offer’d, yet unless he allow the Cheating, and judge the Dice to be
good, there may be hopes of fair Play.</p></li>
