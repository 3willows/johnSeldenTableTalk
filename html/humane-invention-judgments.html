<p>Humane Invention.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>YOU say there must be no Hu∣mane Invention in the Church, nothing
but the pure Word. Answer. If I give any Exposition, but what is
ex∣press’d in the Text, that is my Inventi∣on; if you give another
Exposition, that is your invention, and both are Hu∣mane. For Example,
suppose the Word [Egg] were in the Text, I say, ’tis meant an Hen-Egg,
you say a Goose-Egg, nei∣ther of these are exprest, therefore they are
Humane Inventions, and I am sure the newer the Invention the worse, old
In∣ventions are best.</p></li>
<li><p>If we must admit nothing but what we read in the Bible, what will
become of the Parliament? for we do not read of that there.</p></li>

<p>Iudgments.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>WE cannot tell what is a Judg∣ment of God, ’tis presumption to take
upon us to know. In time of Plague we know we want Health, and therefore
we pray to God to give us Health: in time of War we know we want Peace,
and therefore we pray to God to give us Peace. Commonly we say a
Judgment falls upon a Man for something in him we cannot abide. An
Example we have in King James, con∣cerning the Death of Henry the Fourth
of France; one said he was kill’d for his Wenching, another said he was
kill’d for turning his Religion. No, says King James (who could not
abide fighting,) he was kill’d for permitting Duels in his Kingdom.</li>
