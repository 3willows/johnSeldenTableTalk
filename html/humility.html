<p>Humility.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>HUmility is a Vertue all preach, none practise, and yet every
bo∣dy is content to hear. The Master thinks it good Doctrine for his
Servant, the Laity for the Clergy, and the Clergy for the
Laity.</p></li>
<li><p>There is Humilitas quaedam in Vitio. If a Man does not take
notice of that Excellency and Perfection that is in him∣self, how can he
be thankful to God, who is the Author of all Excellency and Perfection?
Nay, if a Man hath too mean an Opinion of himself, ’twill render him
unserviceable both to God and Man.</p></li>
<li><p>Pride may be allow’d to this or that degree, else a Man cannot
keep up his Dignity. In Gluttony there must be Eat∣ing, in Drunkenness
there must be drink∣ing; ’tis not the eating, nor ’tis not the drinking
that is to be blam’d, but the Ex∣cess. So in Pride.</p></li>
