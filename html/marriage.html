<p>Marriage.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>OF all Actions of a Man’s Life, his Marriage does least concern
other people, yet of all Actions of our Life ’tis most medled with by
other People.</p></li>
<li><p>Marriage is nothing but a civil Con∣tract; ’tis true, ’tis an
Ordinance of God: so is every other Contract, God com∣mands me to keep
it when I have made it.</p></li>
<li><p>Marriage is a desperate thing; the Frogs in Aesop were extream
wise, they had a great mind to some Water, but they would not leap into
the Well, be∣cause they could not get out again.</p></li>
<li><p>We single out particulars, and ap∣ply God’s Providence to them,
thus when two are marry’d and have undone one another, they cry it was
God’s Provi∣dence we should come together, when God’s Providence does
equally concur to every thing.</p></li>
