<p>War.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>DO not under-value an Enemy by whom you have been worsted. When
our Country-men came home from fighting with the Saracens, and were
beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible Faces (as
you still see the Sign of the Saracen’s Head is) when in truth they were
like other Men. But this they did to save their own Credits.</p></li>
<li><p>Martial-Law in general, means no∣thing but the Martial-Law of
this, or that Place; with us to be us’d in Fervore Bel∣li, in the Face
of the Enemy, not in time of Peace; there they can take a∣way neither
Limb nor Life. The Com∣manders need not complain for want of it, because
our Ancestors have done gal∣lant things without it.</p></li>
<li><p>Question. Whether may Subjects take up Arms against their Prince?
Answer. Conceive it thus; Here lies a Shilling be∣twixt you and me; Ten
Pence of the Shilling is yours, Two Pence is mine: By agreement, I am as
much King of my Two Pence, as you of your Ten Pence: If you therefore go
about to take away my Two Pence, I will defend it; for there you and I
are equal, both Princes.</p></li>
<li><p>Or thus, two supream Powers meet; one says to the other, give me
your Land; if you will not, I will take it from you: The other, because
he thinks himself too weak to resist him, tells him, of nine Parts I
will give you three, so I may quiet∣ly enjoy the rest, and I will become
your Tributary. Afterwards the Prince comes to exact six Parts, and
leaves but three; the Contract then is broken, and they are in Parity
again.</p></li>
<li><p>To know what Obedience is due to the Prince, you must look into
the Contract betwixt him and his People; as if you wou’d know what Rent
is due from the Tenant to the Landlord, you must look into the Lease.
When the Contract is broken, and there is no third Person to judge, then
the Decision is by Arms. And this is the Case between the Prince and the
Subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Question. What Law is there to take up Arms against the Prince,
in Case he break his Covenant? Answer. Though there be no written Law
for it, yet there is Custom, which is the best Law of the Kingdom; for
in England they have al∣ways done it. There is nothing exprest between
the King of England and the King of France; that if either Invades the
other’s Territory, the other shall take up Arms against him, and yet
they do it upon such an Occasion.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis all one to be plunder’d by a Troop of Horse, or to have a
Man’s Goods taken from him by an Order from the Council Table. To him
that dies, ’tis all one whether it be by a Pen∣ny Halter, or a Silk
Garter; yet I con∣fess the silk Garter pleases more; and like Trouts, we
love to be tickled to Death.</p></li>
<li><p>The Soldiers say they fight for Ho∣nour; when the Truth is they
have their Honour in their Pocket. And they mean the same thing that
pretend to fight for Religion. Just as a Parson goes to Law with his
Parishioners; he says, For the good of his Successors, that the Church
may not loose its Right; when the mean∣ing is to get the Tythes into his
own Pocket.</p></li>
<li><p>We govern this War as an unskil∣ful Man does a Casting-Net; if he
has not the right trick to cast the Net off his Shoulder, the Leads will
pull him in∣to the River. I am afraid we shall pull our selves into
Destruction.</p></li>
<li><p>We look after the particulars of a Battle, because we live in the
very time of War. Whereas of Battles past we hear nothing but the Number
slain. Just as for the the Death of a Man; when he is sick, we talk how
he slept this Night, and that Night; what he eat, and what he drunk: But
when he is dead, we only say, he died of a Fever, or name his Disease;
and there’s an end.</p></li>
<li><p>Boccaline has this passage of Soul∣diers, They came to Apollo to
have their Profession made the Eighth Liberal Sci∣ence, which he
granted. As soon as it was nois’d up and down, it came to the Butchers,
and they desired their Professi∣on might be made the Ninth: For say
they, the Soldiers have this Honour for the killing of Men; now we kill
as well as they; but we kill Beasts for the pre∣serving of Men, and why
should not we have Honour likewise done to us? Apol∣lo could not Answer
their Reasons, so he revers’d his Sentence, and made the Sol∣diers Trade
a Mystery, as the Butchers is.</p></li>
