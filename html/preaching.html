<p>Preaching.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>NOthing is more mistaken than that Speech [Preach the Gospel] for
’tis not to make long Harangues, as they do now a days, but to tell the
News of Christ’s coming into the World; and when that is done, or where
’tis known already, the Preacher’s Work is done.</p></li>
<li><p>Preaching in the first sense of the word ceas’d as soon as ever
the Gospel was written.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Preacher says, this is the Meaning of the Holy Ghost in
such a place, in sense he can mean no more than this; that is, I by
studying of the place, by comparing one place with a∣nother; by weighing
what goes before, and what comes after, think this is the Meaning of the
Holy Ghost; and for shortness of Expression I say, the Holy Ghost says
thus, or this is the Meaning of the Spirit of God. So the Judge speaks
of the King’s Proclamation, this is the Intention of the King; not that
the King had declared his Intention any other way to the Judge, but the
Judge examin∣ing the Contents of the Proclamation, ga∣thers by the
purport of the Words the King’s Intention; and then for shortness of
expression says, this is the King’s In∣tention.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing is Text but what was spo∣ken in the Bible, and meant
there for Per∣son and Place, the rest is Application, which a discreet
Man may do well; but ’tis his Scripture, not the Holy Ghost.</p></li>
<li><p>Preaching by the Spirit (as they call it) is most esteemed by the
Common-peo∣ple, because they cannot abide Art or Learning, which they
have not been bred up in. Just as in the Business of Fen∣cing; if one
Country Fellow amongst the rest, has been at the School, the rest will
under-value his Skill, or tell him he wants Valour: You come with your
School-Tricks: There’s Dick Butcher has ten times more Mettle in him: So
they say to the Preach∣ers, You come with your School-Learning: There’s
such a one has the Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tone in preaching does much in working upon the peoples
Affections. If a Man should make Love in an ordina∣ry Tone, his Mistress
would not regard him; and therefore he must whine. If a Man should cry
Fire, or Murther in an ordinary Voice, no body would come out to help
him.</p></li>
<li><p>Preachers will bring any thing into the Text. The young Masters
of Arts preached against Non-Residency in the University; whereupon the
Heads made an Order, that no Man should med∣dle with any thing but what
was in the Text. The next Day one preach’d up∣on these Words, Abraham
begot Isaac: when he had gone a good way, at last he observ’d, that
Abraham was Resident; for if he had been Non-Resident, he could never
have begot Isaac; and so fell foul upon the Non-Residents.</p></li>
<li><p>I could never tell what often preach∣ing meant after a Church is
settled, and we know what is to be done; ’tis just as if a Husband-man
should once tell his Servants what they are to do, when to sow, when to
reap, and afterwards one should come and tell them twice or thrice a Day
what they know already. You must sow your Wheat in October, you must
reap your Wheat in August, &amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>The main Argument why they would have two Sermons a Day, is,
because they have two Meals a Day; the Soul must be fed as well as the
Body. But I may as well argue, I ought to have two No∣ses, because I
have two Eyes, or two Mouths because I have two Ears. What have Meals
and Sermons to do one with another?</p></li>
<li><p>The Things between God and Man are but a few, and those,
forsooth, we must be told often of; but things be∣tween Man and Man are
many; those I hear of not above twice a Year, at the Assizes, or once a
Quarter at the Sessi∣ones; but few come then: nor does the Minister
exhort the People to go at these times to learn their Duty towards their
Neighbours. Often preaching is sure to keep the Minister in Countenance,
that he may have something to do.</p></li>
<li><p>In preaching they say more to raise Men to love Vertue than Men
can possibly perform, to make them do their best; as if you would teach
a Man to throw the Bar; to make him put out his Strength, you bid him
throw further than it is possible for him, or any Man else: Throw over
yonder House.</p></li>
<li><p>In preaching they do by Men as Writers of Romances do by their
chief Knights, bring them into many Dangers, but still fetch them off:
So they put Men in fear of Hell, but at last bring them to
Heaven.</p></li>
<li><p>Preachers say, do as I say, not as I do. But if a Physician had
the same Disease upon him that I have, and he should bid me do one
thing, and he do quite another, could I believe him?</p></li>
<li><p>Preaching the same Sermon to all sorts of People, is, as if a
School-Master should read the same Lesson to his several Forms: If he
reads Amo, amas, amavi, the highest Forms Laugh at him; the younger Boys
admire him: So ’tis in preaching to a mix’d Auditory. Obj. But it cannot
be otherwise; the Parish can∣not be divided into several Forms: What
must the Preacher then do in Dis∣cretion? Answ. Why then let him use
some expressions by which this or that condition of people may know such
Do∣ctrine does more especially concern them, it being so delivered that
the wisest may be contented to hear. For if he deli∣vers it altogether,
and leaves it to them to single out what belongs to themselves (which is
the usual way) ’tis as if a Man would bestow Gifts upon Children of
several Ages: Two Years old, Four Years old, Ten Years old, &amp;c. and
there he brings Tops, Pins, Points, Ribbands, and casts them all in a
Heap together upon a Table before them; though the Boy of Ten Years old
knows how to chuse his Top, yet the Child of Two Years old, that should
have a Ribband, takes a Pin, and the Pin e’er he be aware pricks his
Fingers, and then all’s out of Order, &amp;c. Preaching for the most
part is the glory of the Preacher, to shew himself a fine Man.
Catechising would do much bet∣ter.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the best Arguments to per∣swade, though but few understand;
for the Ignorant will sooner believe the ju∣dicious of the Parish, than
the Preacher himself; and they teach when they dis∣sipate what he has
said, and believe it the sooner confirm’d by Men of their own side. For
betwixt the Laity and the Clergy there is, as it were, a continual
driving of a bargain; something the Clergy would still have us be at,
and therefore many things are heard from the Preacher with suspicion.
They are af∣fraid of some ends, which are easily as∣sented to, when they
have it from some of themselves. ’Tis with a Sermon as ’tis with a Play;
many come to see it, which do not understand it; and yet hearing it
cry’d up by one, whose judg∣ment they cast themselves upon, and of power
with them, they swear and will die in it, that ’tis a very good Play,
which they would not have done if the Priest himself had told them so.
As in a great School, ’tis the Master that teaches all; the Monitor does
a great deal of work, it may be the Boys are affraid to see the Master:
so in a Parish ’tis not the Minister does all; the greater Neighbour
teaches the lesser, the Master of the House teach∣es his Servant,
&amp;c.</p></li>
<li><p>First in your Sermons use your Logick, and then your Rhetorick.
Rhe∣torick without Logick is like a Tree with Leaves and Blosoms, but no
Root; yet I confess more are taken with Rhe∣torick than Logick, because
they are catch∣ed with a free Expression, when they un∣derstand not
Reason. Logick must be natural, or it is worth nothing at all: Your
Rhetorick Figures may be learn’d: That Rhetorick is best which is most
sea∣sonable and most catching. An instance we have in that old blunt
Commander at Cadis, who shew’d himself a good O∣ratour, being to say
something to his Soldiers (which he was not us’d to do;) he made them a
Speech to this purpose; What a shame will it be, you English-men, that
feed upon good Beef and Brewess, to let those Rascally Spaniards beat
you that eat nothing but Oranges and Limons. And so put more Courage
into his Men than he could have done with a more learned Oration.
Rhetorick is very good, or stark naught: There’s no Medium in
Rhe∣torick. If I am not fully perswaded I laugh at the Oratour.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis good to preach the same thing again, for that’s the way to
have it learn’d. You see a Bird by often whist∣ling to learn a Tune, and
a Month af∣ter record it to her self.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis a hard Case a Minister should be turned out of his Living
for some∣thing they inform he should say in his Pulpit. We can no more
know what a Minister said in his Sermon by two or three words pickt out
of it, than we can tell what Tune a Musician play’d last upon the Lute,
by two or three sin∣gle Notes.</p></li>
