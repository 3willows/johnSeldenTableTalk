<p>Gentlemen.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What a Gentleman is, ’tis hard with us to define; in other
Countries he is known by his Priviledges; in West∣minster-Hall he is one
that is reputed one; in the Court of Honour, he that hath Arms. The King
cannot make a Gentle∣man of Blood [what have you said] nor God Almighty,
but he can make a Gentle∣man by Creation. If you ask which is the better
of these two, Civilly, the Gentleman of Blood, Morally, the Gen∣tleman
by Creation may be the better; for the other may be a Debauch’d Man,
this a Person of Worth.</p></li>
<li><p>Gentlemen have ever been more Temperate in their Religion, than
the common People, as having more Reason, the others running in a hurry.
In the beginning of Christianity, the Fathers writ Contra gentes, and
Contra Gentiles, they were all one: But after all were Christi∣ans, the
beter sort of People still retain’d the Name of Gentiles, throughout the
four Provinces of the Roman Empire; as Gentil-hommel in French, Gentil
homo, in Italian, Gentil-huombre in Spanish, and Gentil-man in English:
And they, no que∣stion, being Persons of Quality, kept up those Feasts
which we borrow from the Gentils; as Christmas, Candlemas, May∣day,
&amp;c. continuing what was not direct∣ly against Christianity, which
the com∣mon People would never have endured.</p></li>
