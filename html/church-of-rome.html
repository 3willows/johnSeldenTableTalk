<p>Church of Rome.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BEfore a Juglar’s Tricks are disco∣ver’d we admire him, and give
him Money, but afterwards we care not for them; so ’twas before the
Discove∣ry of the Juggling of the Church of Rome.</p></li>
<li><p>Catholicks say, we out of our Charity believe they of the Church
of Rome may be saved: But they do not believe so of us. Therefore their
Church is better according to our selves: First, some of them no doubt
believe as well of us, as we do of them, but they must not say so:
Besides, is that an Ar∣gument their Church is better than ours because
it has less Charity?</p></li>
<li><p>One of the Church of Rome will not come to our Prayers, does that
agree he doth not like them? I would fain see a Catholick leave his
Dinner, because a No∣bleman’s Chaplain says Grace, nor haply would he
leave the Prayers of the Church, if going to Church were not made a Mark
of Distinction between a Protestant and a Papist.</p></li>
