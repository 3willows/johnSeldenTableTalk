<p>Traitor.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>TIS not seasonable to call a Man Traitor that has an Army at his
Heels. One with an Army is a Gallant man. My Lady Cotten was in the
right, when she laugh’d at the Dutchess of Rich∣mond for taking such
State upon her, when she could Command no Forces. [She a Dutchess,
there’s in Flanders a Dutchess in∣deed; meaning the Arch-Dutchess.</li>

<p>Trinity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THE second Person is made of a piece of Bread by the Papists, the
Third Person is made of his own Frenzy, Malice, Ignorance and Folly, by
the Roundhead [to all these the Spirit is intituled,] One the Baker
makes, the other the Cobler; and betwixt those Two, I think the First
Person is sufficient∣ly abused.</li>
