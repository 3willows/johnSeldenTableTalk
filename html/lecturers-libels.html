<p>Lecturers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LEcturers do in a Parish Church what the Fryers did heretofore,
get away not only the Affections, but the Bounty, that should be
bestow’d up∣on the Minister.</p></li>
<li><p>Lecturers get a great deal of Mo∣ney, because they preach the
People tame [as a Man watches a Hawk] and then they do what they list
with them.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lectures in Black Fryers, per∣form’d by Officers of the Army,
Trades∣men, and Ministers, is as if a great Lord should make a Feast,
and he would have his Cook dress one Dish, and his Coach-Man another,
his Porter a third, &amp;c.</p></li>

<p>Libels.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THough some make slight of Libels, yet you may see by them how the
Wind sits: As take a Straw and throw it up into the Air, you shall see
by that which way the Wind is, which you shall not do by casting up a
Stone. More solid Things do not shew the Complexion of the times so
well, as Ballads and Libels.</li>
