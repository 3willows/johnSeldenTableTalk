<p>Trade.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THere is no Prince in Christendom but is directly a Tradesman,
tho’ in another way than an ordinary Trades∣man. For the purpose, I have
a Man; I bid him lay out twenty Shillings in such Commodities; but I
tell him for every Shilling he lays out I will have a Penny. I trade as
well as he. This every Prince does in his Customs.</p></li>
<li><p>That which a Man is bred up in, he thinks no cheating; as your
Trades∣man thinks not so of his Profession, but calls it a Mystery.
Whereas if you would teach a Mercer to make his Silks heavi∣er, than
what he has been used to, he would peradventure think that to be
cheating.</p></li>
<li><p>Every Tradesman professes to cheat me, that asks for his
Commodity twice as much as it is worth.</p></li>
