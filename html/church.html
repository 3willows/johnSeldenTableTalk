<p>Church.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>HEretofore the Kingdom let the Church alone, let them do what
they would, because they had something else to think of, (viz.) Wars;
but now in time of Peace, we begin to examine all things, will have
nothing but what we like, grow dainty and wanton, just as in a Family
the Heir uses to go a hunting, he never considers how his Meal is drest,
takes a bit, and away; but when he stays within, then he grows curious,
he does not like this, nor he does not like that he will have his Meat
drest his own way, or peradventure he will dress it himself.</p></li>
<li><p>It hath ever been the Gain of the Church when the King will let
the Church have no Power to cry down the King and cry up the Church: But
when the Church can make use of the King’s Pow∣er, then to bring all
under the King’s Prerogative, the Catholicks of England go one way, and
the Court-Clergy ano∣ther.</p></li>
<li><p>A glorious Church is like a magni∣ficent Feast, there is all the
Variety that may be, but every one chuses out a Dish or two that he
likes, and lets the rest alone: how glorious soever the Church is, every
one chuses out of it his own Reli∣gion, by which he governs himself, and
lets the rest alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The Laws of the Church are most favourable to the Church, because
they were the Church’s own making; as the Heralds are the best
Gentlemen, because they make their own Pedigree.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a Question about that Ar∣ticle, concerning the Power of
the Church, whether these Words [of having Power in Controversies of
Faith] were not stoln in, but ’tis most certain they were in the Book of
Articles that was confirm’d, though in some Editions they have been left
out: But the Article before tells you, who the Church is, not the
Clergy, but Coetus sidelium.</p></li>
