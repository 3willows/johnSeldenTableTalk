<li><p>CEremony keeps up all things; ’Tis like a Penny-Glass to a rich

they take themselves slighted without it. And were they not used with
Ceremony, with Complements and Addresses, with Legs and Kissing of
Hands, they were the pi∣tifulest Creatures in the World; but yet
methinks to kiss their Hands after their Lips, as some do, is like
little Boys, that after they eat the Apple, fall to the Paring, out of a
Love they have to the Apple.</p></li>
