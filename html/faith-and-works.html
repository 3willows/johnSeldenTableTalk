<p>Faith and Works.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>TWas an unhappy Division that has been made between Faith and Works:
tho’ in my Intellect I may divide them, just as in the Candle, I know
there is both Light and Heat. But yet put out the Candle, and they are
both gone, one remains not without the other: So ’tis be∣twixt Faith and
Works; nay, in a right Conception Fides est opus, if I believe a thing
because I am commanded, that is Opus.</li>
