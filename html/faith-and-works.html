<p>Faith and Works. 1. TWas an unhappy Division that has been made
between Faith and Works: tho’ in my Intellect I may divide them, just as
in the Candle, I know there is both Light and Heat. But yet put out the
Candle, and they are both gone, one remains not without the other: So
’tis be∣twixt Faith and Works; nay, in a right Conception Fides est
opus, if I believe a thing because I am commanded, that is Opus.</p>
