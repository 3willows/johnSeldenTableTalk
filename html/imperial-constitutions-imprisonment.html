<p>Imperial Constitutions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THey say Imperial Constitutions did only confirm the Canons of the
Church; but that is not so, for they inflicted Punishment, when the
Canons never did (viz.) If a Man converted a Christian to be a Jew, he
was to forfeit his Estate, and lose his Life. In Valentines Novels, ’tis
said, Constat Episcopus Fo∣rum Legibus non habere, &amp; Judicant
tan∣tum de Religione.</li>

<p>Imprisonment.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SIR Kenelme Digby was several times taken and let go again, at last
im∣prison’d in Winchester House. I can com∣pare him to nothing but a
great Fish that we catch and let go again, but still he will come to the
Bait; at last therefore we put him into some great Pond for Store.</li>
