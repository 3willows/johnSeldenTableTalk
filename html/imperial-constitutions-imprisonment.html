<p>Imperial Constitutions. 1. THey say Imperial Constitutions did only
confirm the Canons of the Church; but that is not so, for they inflicted
Punishment, when the Canons never did (viz.) If a Man converted a
Christian to be a Jew, he was to forfeit his Estate, and lose his Life.

<p>Imprisonment. 1. SIR Kenelme Digby was several times taken and let go
again, at last im∣prison’d in Winchester House. I can com∣pare him to
nothing but a great Fish that we catch and let go again, but still he
will come to the Bait; at last therefore we put him into some great Pond
for Store.</p>
