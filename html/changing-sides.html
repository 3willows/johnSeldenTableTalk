<p>Changing Sides. 1. ’TIS the Tryal of a Man to see if he will change
his side; and if he be so weak as to change once, he will change again.
Your Country Fellows have a way to try if a Man be weak in the Hams, by
coming behind him and giving him a Blow unawares, if he bend once, he
will bend again.</p>

<li><p>The Lords that fall from the King after they have got Estates, by
base Flattery at Court, and now pretend Con∣science, do as a Vintner,
that when he first sets up, you may bring your Wench to his House, and
do your things there; But when he grows Rich, he turns con∣scientious,
and will sell no Wine upon the Sabbath-day.</p></li>

<li><p>After Luther had made a Combusti∣on in Germany about Religion, he
was sent to by the Pope, to be taken off, and offer’d any Preferment in
the Church, that he would make choice of: Luther an∣swered, if he had
offer’d half as much at first, he would have accepted it; but now he had
gone so far, he could not come back: In Truth he had made him∣self a
greater thing than they could make him; the German Princes courted him,
he was become the Author of a Sect ever after to be call’d Lutherans. So
have our Preachers done that are against the Bishops; they have made
themselves greater with the People than they can be made the other way;
and therefore there is the less Charity probably in bringing them off.
Charity to Strangers is enjoyn’d in the Text; by Strangers is there
under∣stood those that are not of our own Kin, Strangers to your Blood;
not those you cannot tell whence they come, that is, to be charitable to
your Neighbours whom you know to be honest poor People.</p></li>
