<p>Wit.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WIT and Wisdom differ; Wit is upon the sudden turn, Wisdom is in
bringing about ends.</p></li>
<li><p>Nature must be the ground-work of Wit and Art; otherwise whatever
is done will prove but Jack-puddings work.</p></li>
<li><p>Wit must grow like Fingers; if it be taken from others, ’tis like
Plums stuck upon black Thorns; there they are for a while, but they come
to nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>He that will give himself to all man∣ner of ways to get Money may
be rich; so he that lets fly all he knows or thinks, may by chance be
Satyrically Witty. Ho∣nesty sometimes keeps a Man from grow∣ing Rich;
and Civility from being Witty.</p></li>
<li><p>Women ought not to know their own Wit, because they will still be
shew∣ing it, and so spoil it; like a Child that will continually be
shewing its fine new Coat, till at length it all bedawbs it with its pah
Hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Fine Wits destroy themselves with their own Plots, in medling
with great Affairs of State. They commonly do as the Ape that saw the
Gunner put Bullets in the Cannon, and was pleas’d with it, and he would
be doing so too: at last he puts himself into the Piece, and so both
Ape, and Bullet were shot away together.</p></li>
