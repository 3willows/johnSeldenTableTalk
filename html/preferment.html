<p>Preferment.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WHen you would have a Child go to such a place, and you find him
unwilling, you tell him he shall ride a Cock-horse, and then he will go
presently: So do those that govern the State, deal by Men, to work them
to their Ends; they tell them they shall be advanc’d to such or such a
place, and they will do any thing they would have them.</p></li>
<li><p>A great Place strangely qualifies. John Read (was in the right)
Groom of the Chamber to my Lord of Kent. At∣torney Noy being dead, some
were say∣ing, how would the King do for a fit Man? Why, any Man (says
John Read) may execute the Place. I warrant (says my Lord) thou thinkst
thou understand’st enough to perform it. Yes, quoth John, Let the King
make me Attorney, and I would fain see that Man, that durst tell me,
there’s any thing I understand not.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Pageants are a coming there’s a great thrusting and a
riding up∣on one another’s Backs, to look out at the Window; stay a
little and they will come just to you, you may see them quietly. So ’tis
when a new States-man or Officer is chosen; there’s great expe∣ctation
and listning who it should be; stay a while, and you may know
qui∣etly.</p></li>
<li><p>Missing Preferment makes the Pres∣byters fall foul upon the
Bishops: Men that are in hopes and in the way of rising, keep in the
Channel, but they that have none, seek new ways: ’Tis so amongst the
Lawyers; he that hath the Judges Ear, will be very observant of the way
of the Court; but he that hath no regard will be flying out.</p></li>
<li><p>My Lord Digby having spoken some∣thing in the House of Commons,
for which they would have question’d him, was presently called to the
upper House. He did by the Parliament as an Ape when he hath done some
waggery; his Master spies him, and he looks for his Whip, but before he
can come at him, whip says he to the top of the House.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the Parliament were discon∣tented, that they wanted
places at Court, which others had got; but when they had them once, then
they were quiet. Just as at a Christning some, that get no Sugar Plums,
when the rest have, mutter and grumble; presently the Wench comes a∣gain
with her Basket of Sugar-plums, and then they catch and scramble, and
when they have got them, you hear no more of them.</p></li>
