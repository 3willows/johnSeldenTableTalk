<p>Patience.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>PAtience is the chiefest fruit of Stu∣dy, a Man that strives to make
himself a different thing from other Men by much reading, gains this
chiefest Good, that in all Fortunes, he hath something to entertain and
comfort himself withal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Peace.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>KIng James was pictur’d going easi∣ly down a Pair of Stairs, and
up∣pon every Step there was written, Peace, Peace, Peace; the wisest way
for men in these times is to say nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>When a Country-wench cannot get her Butter to come, she says, the
Witch is in her Churn. We have been churn∣ing for Peace a great while,
and ’twill not come, sure the Witch is in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Though we had Peace, yet ‘twill be a great while e’er things be
settled: Tho’ the Wind lie, yet after a Storm the Sea will work a great
while.</p></li>
