<p>Christmass. 1. CHristmass succeeds the Saturnalia, the same time, the
same number of Holy-days, then the Master waited upon the Servant like
the Lord of Mis∣rule.</p>

<li>Our Meats and our Sports (much of them) have Relation to
Church-works. The Coffin of our Christmass-Pies in shape long, is in
Imitation of the Cratch; our chusing Kings and Queens on Twelfth-Night,
hath reference to the three Kings. So likewise our eating of Fritters,
whipping of Tops, roasting of Herrings, Jack of Lents, &amp;c. they were
all in Imitation of Church-works, Emblems of Martyr∣dom. Our Tansies at
Easter have reference to the bitter Herbs; tho’ at the same time ’twas
always the Fashion for a Man to have a Gammon of Bacon, to shew him∣self
to be no Jew.</li>
