<p>Synod Assembly.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WE have had no national Synod since the Kingdom hath been
settled, as now it is, only Provincial; and there will be this
inconveniency, to call so many Divines together; ’twill be to put Power
in their Hands, who are too apt to usurp it, as if the Laity were bound
by their Determination. No, let the Laity consult with Divines on all
sides, hear what they say, and make them∣selves Masters of their
Reasons; as they do by any other profession, when they have a Difference
before them. For Ex∣ample, Gold-smiths, they enquire of them, if such a
Jewel be of such a Value, and such a Stone of such a Value, hear them,
and then being rational Men judge them∣selves.</p></li>
<li><p>Why should you have a Synod, when you have a Convocation already,
which is a Synod? Would you have a superfetation of another Synod? The
Clergy of England when they cast off the Pope, submitted themselves to
the Ci∣vil Power, and so have continued; but these challenge to be Jure
Divino, and so to be above the Civil Power; these chal∣lenge Power to
call before their Presby∣teries all Persons for all Sins directly
a∣gainst the Law of God, as proved to be Sins by necessary Consequence.
If you would buy Gloves, send for a Glover or two, not Glovers-Hall;
consult with some Divines, not send for a Body.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be some Laymen in the Synod, to over-look the Clergy,
lest they spoil the civil Work: Just as when the good Woman puts a Cat
into the Milk-House to kill a Mouse, she sends her Maid to look after
the Cat, lest the Cat should eat up the Cream.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Ordinance for the Assembly, the Lords and Commons go under
the Names of learned, godly, and judicious Divines; there is no
Difference put be∣twixt them, and the Ministers in the Context.</p></li>
<li><p>’Tis not unusual in the Assembly to revoke their Votes, by reason
they make so much haste, but ’tis that will make them scorn’d. You never
heard of a Coun∣cil revok’d an Act of its own making; they have been
wary in that, to keep up their Infallibility; if they did any thing,
they took away the whole Council, and yet we would be thought Infallible
as any Body. ’Tis not enough to say, the House of Commons revoke their
Votes, for theirs are but Civil Truths, which they by agreement create,
and uncreate, as they please: But the Truths the Synod deals in are
Divine; and when they have voted a thing, if it be then true, ’twas true
before; not true because they voted it, nor does it cease to be true,
because they voted otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribing in a Synod, or to the Articles of a Synod, is no such
terrible thing as they make it; because, If I am of a Synod, ’tis
agreed, either tacitely or expresly. That which the major part
determines, the rest are involv’d in; and therefore I subscribe, though
my own private Opinion be otherwise; and up∣on the same Ground, I may
without scru∣ple subscribe to what those have deter∣min’d, whom I sent,
though my private Opinion be otherwise, having respect to that which is
the Ground of all assem∣blies, the Major part carries it.</p></li>
