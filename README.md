From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Selden):

> John Selden (16 December 1584 – 30 November 1654) was an English jurist, a scholar of England's ancient laws and constitution and scholar of Jewish law.

From [Sir John Soane's Museum Collection Online](https://collections.soane.org/b9897):

>The 'table talk' of the lawyer and scholar John Selden was compiled in the 1640s by his amanuensis Richard Milward and first published posthumously in 1689. The contents are arranged alphabetically in short sections devoted mainly to issues of religion, morality, and politics.

Note: this project was made *without* any Javascript.  All the repetitions are instead done by tools such as bash, pandocs, and ChatGPT.  The result is code that is very difficult to change or maintain.  For more about the development process see [here](https://github.com/3willows/johnSeldenTableTalk/blob/main/History.md).

I considered refactoring it with Javascript, but decided to leave it as a record of my first step in the web development journey.
